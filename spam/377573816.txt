Well I am back on the road. Before I go, I got an interview that I did with Dr. Dan Ritchie. Dan has a fitness center that works with older adults and a lot of his clients have pain and injury issues. He wanted to get my take on what to do about joint pain. Here you go: [1][knee-pain-what-to-do.png] I did the interview last month in San Diego and today, I am heading back to San Diego to go to TT Summit. It should be a great time. Off to San Diego and I will be back soon with updates. Rick Kaselj, MS ..
