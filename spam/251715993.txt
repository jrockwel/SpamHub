Hello! Hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving. As we ramp up towards Internet Prophets LIVE! 2013, the premier Internet, Mobile, and Marketing Workshop that teaches, and helps you implement, the specific tools, techniques, strategies, and shortcuts you need to transform your business, we'd love to have your feedback. Internet Prophets LIVE! 2 will take place April 18-20, 2013 in downtown Chicago at the stunning W Hotel and will feature 17 of the world's leading online authorities as your teachers including Brendon Burchard, Joel Comm, Stephen Messer (co-founder of LinkShare), Jake Nickell (co-founder of Threadless.com), Ross Kimbarovsky (co-founder of crowdSPRING.com), Kit Codik (CEO of co-founder of Liquor.com) and many others. Internet Prophets LIVE! 2012 was packed to the brim with over 370 attendees. However, instead of increasing the size of this year’s Workshop, we’ve chosen to make it smaller and will limit this year's attendance to just 300 students so you can receive the personal attention you deserve. If you'd like to be one of the limited number of attendees, please complete the survey shown. One lucky person who completes the survey in its entirety will win a comp ticket to attend ($1,495 Value). We value your privacy and assure you that all responses are kept confidential and will be used for informational purposes only. We appreciate your feedback and thank you very much for your time. Live bold and prophet!
