Everybody has roles, and in your situation, everyone is playing them to perfection. Females are just so much harder than males I think. There's a book that has helped many of us called Stepmonster by Wednesday Martin. Also, check out my blog on Relational Aggression. Many of us here have counted on our husbands to deal with his children. Many of us have tried to win our stepchildren over with kindness. Unfortunately, kindness will not overcome their feelings toward having to share their father. And a lack of boundaries is what is allowing them to continue acting out their feelings. In these situations, kindness is seen as weakness. And referring to your husband is also seen as weakness. It's also seen as validation that they got under your skin. I agree with the others that you will most likely need to start dealing with them directly. Google the "Drama Triangle" and read about it. See if your husband is the rescuer. You and your SD's will swap back and forth between victim and persecutor. You've been the victim so far and your DH has been rescuing you. However, that could change, as you already indicate this as a fear of yours. Passive aggressors HATE confrontation. Their goal is to send you a message and not be held accountable for it. I'm sure just about everybody here is familiar with dealing with passive aggression from their grown stepchildren. One of my SD's could teach a class on eye rolling. You'll see others here post about "disengaging". There is no one shoe that fits all. To each of us, it is different. For me, it included letting go of the hope that we'd ever "blend". It meant accepting things exactly as they are, and my grown SD's for exactly who they are. Apathy is my goal. And since I stopped seeing them as appendages to my DH and more like just humans on the planet, I don't struggle so much with biting my tongue. I'm not cruel to them in the least. When I see them, I am pleasant. PLEASANT. Not gushy, lovey, bubbly, eager for another opportunity to get kicked in the teeth. My husband didn't like the burden of having to protect me. His daughters are all very capable of returning rage toward him. He doesn't like it and shuts down. He once got his ass reamed at a family function, because he referred to me as his "bride"... as in, "I'll meet up with you later, right now I'm taking my lovely bride to lunch." We provided my OSD with the funds to get her degree in Psychology. She does not use it. I thought studying the topic might open her eyes a bit. When I stopped coming around them as often, as part of my disengaging, she told her father that he had allowed me to cut his balls off. Seriously, she said that at the age of 30 and with a psych degree. His children know two ways to engage him. They will either dominate him or they will shun him. They will not co-exist with him. Ultimately, they have not reciprocated in a mutually respectful, loving relationship and his relationship with them has found it's resting place. When I disengaged, he backed off too. He was tired of all the intensity. That has also been a common and often unforeseen occurrence here. I relieved my husband of his duties to protect me. All I've asked is that if they come after me, that he stay out of it. Likewise, I stay out of his relationship with them. If he tolerates them being rude to him, that's his choice. But nobody gets to decide who is rude to me. And oddly enough, after I fully decided to disengage, there haven't been too many times when my SD's have challenged me. When they felt assured that they'd only have to listen to my DH rattle off another sermon about, "Can't we just pleeeeeeease get along?", it was still game on. Now they aren't sure what they are going to get, but I believe they've gotten the message that I'm done taking it. If I were you, I think I'd start by practicing on your SD. If she gave me the stink eye, I'd ask her to please come back so we can talk. Ask her about the look. She'll deny it. I think that's okay. When you call someone on their passive aggression, they'll either deny it or admit it. If they deny it, that's still a win. If they admit it, they are ramping up the game. That can turn into grounds for eviction. But I definitely think you should deal with her directly. How could your DH get mad at you for asking questions? She'll hate it, but what's she going to say? "justmewantingpeace asked me why I was rolling my eyes at her! Then she asked me what my problem is! She told me she will not tolerate being disrespected in HER home! Can you believe that???" I just wouldn't get into a brawl with her, letting her dictate the terms of your encounter. Be cool and she'll run or explode. Will probably be a good lesson for her. Either way, you'll win. ? �I had a really good childhood up until I was nine, then a classic case of divorce really affected me.� - Kurt Cobain "You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I'll rise." - Maya Angelou "He who angers you conquers you." - Eliza Trust me, I WILL defend myself. I do hear what you are saying and I respect that. What is happening in my home is pretty new to me. I have only been married 6 months and getting a crash course in being a step parent. Up until this point, the one that has been living with us has at least been courteous to my face and I just figured the rest was awkwardness that would be cured with time. She is not speaking with me because I DID speak up to her and my husband backed me up when he got home. I don't regret defending myself; but I am left with a difficult situation. She will indeed be shown the door at some point. In all fairness to her, she has never been given a list of rules to live by; something my husband admits he should have done with all his kids in the past. So we all are evolving here and I came to this forum to learn. I do appreciate your reminder that I have a right to this home. And I do have faith my husband wants to protect it and our marriage. Time will tell.
