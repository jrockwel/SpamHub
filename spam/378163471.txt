 Vincent Suber sent you a Private Message: Excuse me for an intrusion, but I couldn't overcome myself not to write You.. So who am I? I'm 36 and I work as a chief engineer of large Building Construction Company in the United States and Europe. I'm pretty easy going and always stay optimistic. I like to be organized, but I sometimes fail at that goal, because I often find myself distracted by new and exciting ideas... ;-) Enjoying life is what motivates me! I prefer traveling in a private jet to the beach and mountains, skiing in Colo and Chamonix France, golfing in Scotland and the past few summers French Rivera, Monte Carlo, and Italy. Would like to find someone to share that time with... I've been single for the past 2 years and I'm ready to mingle with someone different, I am not looking for a replacement...
