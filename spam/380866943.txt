Woke up this morning early with Max. After feeding him his bottle, I couldn't sleep, so I cooked some bacon. Then I started tweaking the webinar presentation that I'm giving today: http://sendnext.com/webinar/ It is an updated version of the incredible training that we did last week related to affiliate marketing. It's also going to push one last time at the end, our AffiliateHD program, which closes tomorrow night. So check it out. Thanks, Jason "how was I a vegetarian for 8 years?" Fladlien ..
