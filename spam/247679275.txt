At a given signal we opened our billets. "Thou art the man," said the slip of paper trembling in my fingers. The sweets and anxieties of a leader were mine the rest of the afternoon. Directly after twilight set in Phil Adams stole down to the wharf and fixed the fuses to the 1381137139 guns, laying a train of powder from the principal fuse to the fence, through a chink of which I was to drop the match at midnight. At ten o'clock Rivermouth goes to bed. At eleven o'clock 1381137139 Rivermouth is as quiet as a country churchyard. At twelve o'clock there is nothing left with which to compare the 7070080218064867762 stillness that broods over the little seaport. In the midst 687accdc7eb777ababfea7aa60cb760c of this stillness I arose and glided out of the house like a phantom bent on an evil errand; like a phantom. I 687accdc7eb777ababfea7aa60cb760c flitted through the silent street, hardly drawing breath until I knelt down beside the fence at the appointed place. Pausing a moment for my 687accdc7eb777ababfea7aa60cb760c heart to 687accdc7eb777ababfea7aa60cb760c stop thumping, I lighted the match and shielded it with both hands until it was well under way, and then dropped the blazing splinter on the slender thread of gunpowder. A noiseless flash instantly followed, and all was dark 1381137139 again. I peeped through the crevice in the fence, and saw the main fuse spitting out sparks like a conjurer. Assured that the train had not failed, I took to my heels, fearful lest the fuse might burn more rapidly than we calculated, and cause an explosion before I could get home. This, luckily, did not happen. There's a special Providence that watches over idiots, drunken men, and boys. I dodged the ceremony of undressing by plunging into bed, jacket, boots, and all. I am not sure I took off my cap; but I know that I had hardly pulled the coverlid over me, when "BOOM!" sounded the first gun of Bailey's Battery. I lay as still NDY1OGFhYmE1Yzk1NTU4OTg5ZmVhN2FhNjBjYjc2MGM_ as a 1381137139 mouse. In less than two minutes there was another burst of thunder, and then another. The third gun was a tremendous fellow and fairly shook the house. The town was waking up. Windows were thrown open NDY1OGFhYmE1Yzk1NTU4OTg5ZmVhN2FhNjBjYjc2MGM_ here and there and people called to each other across the NDY1OGFhYmE1Yzk1NTU4OTg5ZmVhN2FhNjBjYjc2MGM_ streets asking what that firing was for. "BOOM!" went gun number four. I sprung out of bed and tore off my 687accdc7eb777ababfea7aa60cb760c jacket, for I heard the Captain feeling 687accdc7eb777ababfea7aa60cb760c his way along the wall to my chamber. I was half undressed by the time he found the knob of the door. "I say, sir," I cried, 7070080218064867762 "do you hear those guns?" "Not being deaf, I do," said the Captain, a little tartly--any reflection on his hearing always nettled him; "but what on earth they are for I can't conceive. You had better get up and dress yourself." "I'm nearly dressed, sir." "BOOM! BOOM!"--two of the guns had gone off together. The door of Miss Abigail's bedroom opened hastily, and that pink of maidenly propriety stepped out into the hail in her night-gown--the only indecorous thing I ever knew her to do. She held a lighted candle in her hand and looked like a very aged Lady Macbeth. "O 7070080218064867762 Dan'el, this 7070080218064867762 is dreadful! What do you suppose it means?" "I really can't suppose," said the Captain, rubbing his ear; "but I guess it's over now." "BOOM!" said Bailey's Battery. 1381137139 Rivermouth 7070080218064867762 was wide awake now, and half the male population were in the streets, running different ways, for the firing seemed to proceed from opposite points of the town. Everybody waylaid everybody else with questions; but as no one knew what was the occasion of the tumult, people who were not usually nervous began to be oppressed by the mystery. .
