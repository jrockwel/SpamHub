"Those who know me don't generally doubt my word," said Robert, coldly. "Well, I don't know you, 1378466178 or, at least, not intimately," said Haley, "and you must confess that I haven't the best MTMyNjgyMjlhMjM2MjIxODU3NjkxYzEzZGMxMDVhZDE_ reasons to like you." "Did you suffer much inconvenience 4659b55cd569554b8a991c13dc105ad1 from your wound?" asked Robert. "Not MTMyNjgyMjlhMjM2MjIxODU3NjkxYzEzZGMxMDVhZDE_ much. It proved to be slight. You were a bold boy to wing me. I could have crushed you easily." "I suppose you could, 1378466178 but you know how I was situated. I couldn't run away, and desert your uncle." "I don't know about that. You don't understand that little affair. I MTMyNjgyMjlhMjM2MjIxODU3NjkxYzEzZGMxMDVhZDE_ suppose you think I had no right to the gold I took." "I certainly do think so." "Then you are mistaken. My uncle got his money from my 4659b55cd569554b8a991c13dc105ad1 grandfather. A part should have gone to my mother, and, consequently, to me, but he didn't choose to act honestly. My object in calling upon him was to induce him to do me justice at last. But you know the old man has become a miser, and makes money his idol. The long and short of it was, that, as he wouldn't listen to reason, I determined to take the law into my own hands, and carry off what I thought ought to come to me." Robert listened to this explanation without putting much faith in it. It was not at all according to the story given by Mr. Nichols, and he knew, moreover, that the man before him had passed a wild and dissolute youth. "I suppose what I did was not strictly legal," continued Ben Haley, lightly; "but we sailors are not much versed in the quips of the law. To my 4793335120254773082 thinking, law defeats justice about as often as it aids it." Click this link to unsubscribe: http://services.embaticrit.us/57691c13dc105ad1813268229a2362218
