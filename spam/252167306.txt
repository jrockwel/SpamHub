Oak Plains School, in North Carolina, is typical of many schools built for MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ white children in the late 19th century. It was in service until 1915. I love to do exactly this. Demands MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ for better public education were many. Employers wanted a better educated workforce, at least for the technical jobs. Classical MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ liberals believed that public education was the cornerstone of any democracy. Our system of government MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ could be imperiled if large numbers of uneducated masses voted unwisely. Teaching America's MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ Youth Church leaders and modern liberals were concerned for the welfare of MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ children. They believed that a strong education was not only appropriate, but an inalienable right owed to all. Furthermore, MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ critics of child labor practices wanted longer mandatory school years. After all, if a child was in school, he or she MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ would not be in the factory. In 1870, about half of the nation's children received no formal MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ education whatsoever. Although many states provided for a free public education for children between the ages of 5 and 21, economic realities MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ kept many children working in mines, factories, or on the farm. Only six states had compulsory MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ education laws at this point, and most were for only several weeks per year. Massachusetts MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ was the leader in tightening laws. By 1890, all children in Massachusetts between the ages of 6 and 10 were required to attend MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ school at least twenty weeks per year. These laws were much simpler to enact than to enforce. Truant officers would MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ be necessary to chase down offenders. Private and religious schools would have to be monitored to ensure MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ quality standards similar to public schools. Despite resistance, acceptance of mandatory elementary education began to spread. MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ By the turn of the century such laws were universal throughout the North and West, with the South lagging MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ behind. Under the laws of Jim Crow, the public schools in operation in the South MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ were entirely segregated by race in 1900. Mississippi became the last state to require elementary education in MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ 1918. Other reforms began to sweep the nation. Influenced by German immigrants, MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ kindergartens sprouted in urban areas, beginning with St. Louis in 1873. Demands for better trained teachers MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ led to an increase in "normal" schools, colleges that specialized in preparation to teach. By 1900, one in five public MTMyMzcyNDNhNzY2YTE3OGVhMmE5MWI4YzNhZTcwNjY_ school teachers had a degree. Click this link to unsubscribe: http://support.koutwolof.us/ea2a91b8c3ae7066113237243a766a178
