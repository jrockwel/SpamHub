The following is an important message from ListJoe.com Admin =========================================================== Where did they all come from? Well they won't last. We have indeed noticed the recent and dramatic rise in spam and frame breakers. We are doing a revamp of the anti-cheat scripts and plugging any remaining holes. We are also going to auto pre-screen links for frame breakers. You should see a noticeable difference very soon so you can stop wasting time clicking bad links and start earning lots of credits again. I'm on it! =========================================================== You received this email because you are a member at ListJoe.com.
