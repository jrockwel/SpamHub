In Sweden, (http://icanw.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8fea3b2f9c797c5257f8be45c&id=868810e178&e=45bd356f08) ICAN got everyone talking about the humanitarian statement from the NPT Preparatory Committee and why the Swedish Foreign Minister didn’t sign it. In Costa Rica (http://icanw.us5.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=8fea3b2f9c797c5257f8be45c&id=5a62651a4a&e=45bd356f08) , ICAN campaigners met with Nobel laureate Oscar Arias who agreed to take a photo of his shadow for ICAN’s Share your Shadow campaign. In Nepal (http://icanw.us5.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=8fea3b2f9c797c5257f8be45c&id=0d3cc9be30&e=45bd356f08) , campaigners managed to arrange a meeting with the President and discussed nuclear disarmament with him. In the Netherlands (http://icanw.us5.list-manage.com/track/click?u=8fea3b2f9c797c5257f8be45c&id=4f771ea86f&e=45bd356f08) , ICAN’s partner organizations were everywhere in the media, talking about the recent announcement by two former Prime Ministers about the ill-kept secret of 22 US nuclear warheads being held at the Volkel air base and turning up the pressure on the Dutch government to talk less and do more for a nuclear weapons-free world. In Switzerland (http://icanw.us5.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=8fea3b2f9c797c5257f8be45c&id=4ed8b0c85f&e=45bd356f08) , successful campaigning by ICAN through our “Don’t bank on the bomb” report, resulted in the Swiss Federal Council clearly stating that investing in the production of nuclear weapons is now illegal. And just two days ago, ICAN organized the first ever event about nuclear weapons in the Israeli Knesset (http://icanw.us5.list-manage1.com/track/click?u=8fea3b2f9c797c5257f8be45c&id=d3f49a99bb&e=45bd356f08) , specifically highlighting the catastrophic humanitarian impact that any use of nuclear weapons would cause. For every month that goes by, ICAN campaigners are turning up the intensity of our campaign, and continue to raise awareness about the humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons and the need to negotiate a treaty banning nuclear weapons. We know the humanitarian approach to weapons works as a way to trigger action; it has been the underlying principle and reasons for banning multiple weapons in the past, as well as the testing of nuclear weapons. It is becoming clearer by the day that we are on the right track towards achieving a treaty banning nuclear weapons. ** Nuclear Abolition Week, 6-13 July ------------------------------------------------------------ By Magnus Løvold Nuclear cabin trips, Share Your Shadow photo booths, Target X actions, petition campaigns, nuclear drinks nights, film screenings, public outreach meetings and various meetings with parliamentarians and civil servants - all over the world ICAN campaigners and partner organisations are gearing up with ambitious and creative plans for Nuclear Abolition Week, coming up in less than three weeks.
