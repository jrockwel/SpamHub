The man in the bow seized the boat-hook, and, turning round quickly, showed me the honest face of Sailor Ben of the Typhoon. "It's Sailor Ben!" I cried, nearly pushing Pepper Whitcomb overboard in my excitement. Sailor Ben, with the wonderful pink lady on his arm, and the ships and stars and anchors tattooed all over him, was a well-known hero among my playmates. And there he was, like something in a dream come true! I didn't 687bd779ed8c778b99defb1ae21f2515 wait 696822165 for my old acquaintance to get firmly on the wharf, before I grasped his hand in both of mine. "Sailor Ben, don't you remember me?" He evidently 696822165 did not. He shifted his quid from one cheek to the other, and looked at me meditatively. "Lord love ye, lad, I don't know you. I was never 3052935646351411622 here afore in my life." "What!" I cried, enjoying his perplexity. "Have you forgotten the voyage from New Orleans in the Typhoon, two years ago, you lovely old picture-book?" Ah! then he 696822165 knew 3052935646351411622 me, and in token of the recollection gave my hand such a squeeze that I am sure an unpleasant change came over my countenance. "Bless my eyes, but you have growed so. I shouldn't have knowed you 3052935646351411622 if I had met you in Singapore!" Without stopping to inquire, as I was tempted to do, why he was more 3052935646351411622 likely to recognize me in Singapore than anywhere else, I invited him to come at once up to the Nutter House, where I insured him a warm welcome from the Captain. "Hold steady, Master Tom," said Sailor Ben, slipping the painter through the ringbolt and tying the loveliest knot you ever saw; "hold steady till I see if the mate can let me off. If you please, sir," he continued, 687bd779ed8c778b99defb1ae21f2515 addressing the steersman, a very red-faced, bow-legged person, "this here is a little shipmate o' mine as wants to talk over back times along of me, if so it's convenient." "All right, Ben," returned the mate; "sha'n't want you for an 696822165 hour." Leaving one man in charge of the boat, the MTMyNjgyMjQ5ODM3MjIzNjQ0OGVmYjFhZTIxZjI1MTU_ mate and the rest of the crew went off together. In the meanwhile Pepper Whitcomb had got out his cunner-line, and was quietly fishing at the end of the wharf, as if to give me the idea that he wasn't so very much impressed by my intimacy with so renowned a character as Sailor Ben. Perhaps Pepper was a little jealous. At any rate, he refused to go with us to the house. Captain Nutter was at 696822165 696822165 home reading the Rivermouth Barnacle. He was a reader to do an editor's heart good; he never skipped over an advertisement, even if he had read it fifty times before. Then the paper went the rounds of the neighborhood, among the poor people, like the single portable eye which the three blind crones passed to each other in the legend of King Acrisius. The Captain, I repeat, was wandering in the labyrinths of the Rivermouth Barnacle when I led Sailor Ben into the sitting-room. My grandfather, whose inborn courtesy knew no distinctions, received my nautical friend as if he had been an admiral instead of a common forecastle-hand. Sailor Ben pulled an imaginary tuft of hair on his forehead, and bowed clumsily. Sailors have a way of using their forelock as a sort of handle to bow with. The old 696822165 tar had probably never been in so handsome an apartment in all his days, and nothing could induce him to take the inviting mahogany chair which the Captain wheeled out from the corner. .
