My name is Mrs francia Richard from ottawa canada, i was married to late Dr Richard Graham, a contractor with united nation where we spent all our live and marriage for 32 years in south Africa before his death and we where both blessed with a baby girl that died after 12 years, by the grace of God i have properties and fund which my late husband left behind for me but i am presently in a hospital in london United kingdom receiving treatment of cancer.I am contacting you at this point because the doctor had told me about the worst condition of my health which means i have to go for operation and since i have no child of my own to inherit what i have behind and i can not will this fund to my late husband relative since it's the only thing i have vow to will to God through charity so i will not want anything to jeopardise my dream and that was the reason why i am pleading in the name of God to please assist me to help me accomplish this devine mission without betray because at this point the fund is meaningle I am contacting you because i want to will the sum of $5.2 Million, Five Million Two Hundred Thousand United State Dollars from my bank to assist me to carry out the charity work of God in reaching out to the less previlege, sick people in hospital bed,beggers on the street, widows and prisoners in your country of residence, i want you to understand that the doctor had told me that i have a very short time to dwell on earth and that was what gave me the fear to surpport the work of God through charity because i have nobody to inherit my fund after i die because the few people i trusted so much from my husband relative later disapointed me in every area of assignment by squandering all the money and some part of my late husband properties which i kept in their care and uptill date none of them cares to visit me because they thought i have nothing left behind.
