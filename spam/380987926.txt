Gun control advocates, fearing that every day that passed from the raw emotions of the killings, made their hopes of getting a gun ban in place dwindle, decided to ditch what is complicated or innovative and fall back to old and largely failed ideas.While murder rates have dramatically declined in America over the past two decades, the phenomenon of mass killings has become a cultural sickness. Broken families, a corroded culture, the isolation and alienation of the Internet age, the inadequacy of mental health care and failing schools all play a part.

Most experts say those are unfeasible based on the North's current capacity and would never be explored seriously because the U.S. response would be overwhelming against a regime focused primarily on survival.Kerry said any talks with North Korea have to lead toward denuclearization.They have to be really serious," Kerry said.
