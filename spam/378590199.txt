 Shinji -- We might actually do this! You know all those emails we've sent you about our fundraising deadlines? Well, yesterday both parties released their May numbers -- and we crushed Boehner and the Republicans!!! In fact, we DOUBLED the GOP in grassroots donations. Here's why that matters: all those naysayers who think we can't win a Democratic House for President Obama are waiting to see if our grassroots strength can stack up against Boehner's big-money backers. Right now, that's exactly what's happening! Now that the media is paying attention, our biggest test yet is in 9 days when the midyear fundraising deadline hits. If we can out raise the Republicans for the first six months of 2013, it'll send shock waves throughout Washington, DC (and send Boehner into an all-out panic). Will you be a part of this? Name: Shinji Ikari Supporter record: 13995162 Suggested Support: $3.00 Donate $3 before the midyear fundraising deadline and we'll match your gift >> We need to kick out 17 Tea Party Republicans to win back the House. It won't be easy -- but the first step is proving that a grassroots network of supporters contributing $5 or $25 can compete against the Republicans' corporate cash. So if you're committed to our campaign to win a Democratic House for President Obama, then we need you right now. http://dccc.org/Midyear-Deadline Thank you for your support.
