the Marriott Center City and its s on yelp I was not disappointed Single I was traveling I took a singleton at the counter and was able to watch the magic in action as the counter is really a Chefs table For starters I tried the braised pork belly as recommended and it did not disappoint Crispy outside with a soulful center the Asian slaw that accompanied it was great though the few jalape�os added did over power the dish at times For the main course I enjoyed the bonein pork chop with fried egg The pork chop was prepared slightly over medium but did not detract from the meat as the egg acted as a nice softener The side of fried polenta was more than one could handle but it was tasty when paired with the plates accompanying sauce The bread pudding for dessert was enough for two and was moist warm and enjoyable with whipped cream and caramel sauce Was this Cool Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Rian M friends s Rian M Ketchum ID Yummy Great comfort

Service was ok Friendly but not very attentive for drinks afterwards Was this Cool Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Natalie S friends s Natalie S Hawaii County HI Ive worked in the restaurant industry on and off for over years now My husbands father owns and runs a French restaurant and catering business on the west coast We know what to expect from fine dining We came here this past weekend for our anniversary and were sorely disappointed Wed read s had several people recommend it but it was a let down For a fine dining menu that hides a hamburger in the corner in tiny print as though a patron should be ashamed to order it and marks up their wine so much I dont know why anyone would be stupid enough to order some I would expect more from the presentation of the staff and servers If I get dressed up for a fine dining experience I sort of expect the hostess to have washed hair and a nice appearance and for every server to have the same I dont really understand why the servers would be wearing more formal long aprons but wearing jeans and sneakers Seeing two hostesses dressed in worn out oversized tshirts from Forever and extremely tight worn out jeans as soon as I walk in the doorit just doesnt make a nice impression For lunch maybe Perhaps I think pride in appearance can go a long way towards ambiance It just makes the place seem less refined I think the owner must be slack with his employees because he is trying to make the place seem less pretentious but with the wine markups and the burgershaming I dont really get it Duck confit Over FRENCH FRIES Ok first of all the confit was a little too salty Otherwise very tasty and well paired with the cheese it was mixed with I love duck confit and order it almost every time I go to a restaurant that serves it I asked if I could have it served with saut�ed mushrooms or vegetables instead of fries but my server insisted it would ruin the dish because of the presentation If I wanted meat and steak fries I would go to Outback steakhouse or Texas roadhouse or somewhere equally boring The fact that the confit was already kind of salty was made worse by the fact that it was served over a stack of french fries Also I understand serving portions but even so the amount of confit on the plate was very frugal; and I feel like it was served with a fried filling starch in an attempt to fill stomachs and distract from the sparse serving of duck Fortunately it wasnt one of the more pricey items on the menu Even so it would have been much better without french fries I kind of feel like this place is run by people who dont think their customers are very smart or dining savvy You can still make money on wine by not marking it up so much I know what wine costs I know you make money by marking it up but I also know they arent serving the best wines of all time and that reason alone is why my husband will never go back Im not going to eat again at a place that has so many stars and accolades but dumbs its food down with the cheapest thing you can possibly cook for the sake of being filling and distracting French fries are french fries there is simply nothing that can make them remarkable Was this Cool Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Jennifer S friends s Jennifer S Sandy UT Seated via OpenTable Checkin Here Came here on a Wednesday and got in right away at peak lunch hour even though the place was pretty full I first ordered the honey drop martini which was greattasted very fresh and loved that it just had a hint of honey Wasnt too overpowering which I have found several restaurants tend to do especially in SLC It was perfect My server was very informative about the menu and honest when recommending a dish I took her recommendation to go with their daily special and ordered the Rock Shrimp Po Boy with a side of sauteed snap peas The snap peas were cooked perfectly and were very flavorful Liked that they were topped with grated parmesan The Rock Shrimp Po Boy was absolutely amazing Very very lightly breaded shrimp with a flavorful tartar sauce and freshly baked bread I was dining by myself this day so I took advantage of listening to other fellow Yelpers and sat at the counter to watch everything be made Great recommendation Was fun to watch them make several different dishes and the chefs were very courteous to me too For food service atmosphere and price I give this place without hesitation stars Was this Cool Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Ruben K friends s Ruben K San Francisco CA Great little gem in the heart of Salt Lake City A well thought menu mixes classic bistro food burgers steaks with new american cuisine watermelon gazpacho and oldworld flavors charcuterie and cheese plates The fares are tasty and well executed the ambiance is casual and modern the service is friendly and attentive The wine list is superb too oily food enough to tolerate their crowded communal tables and sometimes snobby servers �I know ill be back soon probably when my nyc girlfriends visit so i can feel nostalgic and remember the good old big apple days �Or maybe Ill try their new sister restaurant Plum Alley given all the recent hype Was this � Cool Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from kahee y friends s kahee y New York NY Checkin Here I was so excited when i found out the copper onion was serving bone marrow Im going to pull my ny snobbery for a second here: the serving sizes are HUGE for back in ny so i was super disappointed when i saw the serving size of halves on to the rest of the food arugula salad great taste pork belly messy presentation but decent taste mussels loved the pepper spice tri tip requested medium rare but was overcooked bone marrow expensive for such a small portion brussels sprouts must have side dish no bread basket = service was extremely spotty our dishes were timed awkwardly and we waited about minutes for our main dishes our server was uncomfortable Was this � Cool Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Todd B Elite friends s Todd B Manhattan NY I came to The Copper Onion while visiting town upon the recommendation of a local friend and it was just as excellent as my friend suggested I was greeted warmly by the host as well as my waiter and contrary to some s the service was attentive and just right I enjoyed a rye whiskey cocktail with lemon orange juice ginger and bitters one of my favorite combinations Though it is not something I normally would choose when given so many enticing options I chose the beef stroganoff I was glad that I did The noodles were homemade the sauce was perfect and the beef tips were grilled My only disappointment was that there was so little beef in my dish maybe pieces Every dish that I observed was beautiful and fresh and the prices were reasonable Was this � Cool � Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend
