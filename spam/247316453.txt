They became bosom-friends in an incredibly brief period, and were never easy out 4707368002025414696 of each 4707368002025414696 other's sight. Prince Zany--that's what Pepper Whitcomb and I christened him one day, much to the disgust of the monkey, who bit a piece out of Pepper's nose--resided in the stable, and went to roost every night on the pony's back, where I usually found him in the morning. Whenever I rode out, I was obliged to secure his Highness the Prince with a stout cord to the fence, he chattering all the time like a madman. One afternoon 4659ba99c54c554da6de0e316e6e1c66 as 87742979 I was cantering through the crowded part of the town, I noticed that the people in the street stopped, stared at me, and fell to laughing. I turned round in the saddle, and there was Zany, with a great burdock leaf in his paw, perched up behind me on the crupper, as solemn as a judge. After a few months, poor Zany sickened mysteriously, and died. The dark thought occurred to me then, and comes back to me now with redoubled force, that Miss Abigail must have given him some hot-drops. Zany left a large circle of sorrowing friends, if not relatives. Gypsy, I think, never entirely recovered from the shock occasioned by his early demise. She became fonder of me, though; and one of her cunningest demonstrations was to escape from the stable-yard, and trot up to the door of the Temple Grammar School, where I would discover her at recess patiently waiting for me, with her fore feet on the second step, and wisps of straw standing out all over her, like quills upon the fretful porcupine. I should 4707368002025414696 fail if I tried to 87742979 tell you how dear the pony was to me. Even hard, unloving men become attached to the horses they take care of; so I, who was neither unloving nor hard, grew to love every glossy hair of the pretty little creature that depended on me for her soft straw bed and her daily modicum of oats. In my prayer at night I never forgot to mention Gypsy with the rest of the family--generally setting forth her claims first. Whatever relates to Gypsy belongs properly to this narrative; therefore I offer no 4707368002025414696 apology for rescuing from oblivion, and boldly printing here a short composition which I MTMyNjg3NjY5MjE5MjIxYTczYWUwZTMxNmU2ZTFjNjY_ wrote in the early part of my first quarter at the Temple Grammar School. It is my maiden effort in a difficult art, and is, perhaps, lacking in those graces of thought and style which are reached only after the severest practice. Every Wednesday morning, on entering school, each 4707368002025414696 pupil was expected to lay his exercise on Mr. Grimshaw's desk; the subject was usually selected by Mr. Grimshaw himself, the Monday previous. With a humor characteristic of him, our teacher had instituted two prizes, one for the best and the other for the worst composition of the month. The first prize consisted of a penknife, or a pencil-case, or some such article dear to the heart of youth; the second prize entitled the winner to wear for an hour or two a sort of conical paper cap, on the front of which was written, in tall letters, this modest admission: I AM A DUNCE! The competitor who took prize No. 2. wasn't generally an object of envy. My pulse beat high with pride and expectation that Wednesday morning, as I laid my 4707368002025414696 essay, neatly folded, on the master's table. I firmly decline to say which prize I won; but here's the composition to speak for itself. . Click this link to unsubscribe: http://space.eigalocke.us/73ae0e316e6e1c665132687669219221a
