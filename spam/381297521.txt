The founder - Gaby Aghion, spotted a void in the market and the notion of Prêt-à-Porter was born. The list of past designers reads like a who's who of fashion's greatest, including Karl Lagerfeld (who took it to iconic status in the 1970s), Stella McCartney and Phoebe Philo. British designer Hannah MacGibbon is the new creative director for this urban label who has the fashion critics watching her every move. MacGibbon's refined take on easy glamour leaves beholders and lovers of the brand lusting for more. *These items are non-exchangeable and non-refundable.   other CURRENT EVENTS   Gucci Sun & RX Glam Rock Watches Riki Rosetta New York Michael Kors Saint Laurent Burberry DKNY Tory Burch Fendi <img src="http://cdn3.reebonz.com/edm_fashion/spacer50.gif" alt
