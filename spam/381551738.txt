I like to go around this time each day because it's nice and quiet since everyone else is working their 9-5's! Anyway... I want to give you a game plan and literally share the EXACT "how-to" steps to make a full time income online. 1 - Get traffic The first thing you need to be able to do is get traffic. Encase you're a complete newbie to all this traffic means visitors (people!). So the first thing you need to be able to do is generate traffic. 2 - Build a list / get leads The 2nd thing you need to do is actually do something with the traffic you generate. A lot of people out there will tell you to send that traffic to an affiliate offer and make some money, but that's WRONG! Most people never buy a product the first time they see it, so if you send your traffic directly to an affiliate product you'll never see 99% of that traffic again... it's gone forever! So you need to actually send the traffic you generate to a lead capture page (this is also known in the industry as a squeeze page or a capture page) and will capture that persons email address, so that you can build a subscriber list. Its crucially important that you build a list so that you can connect with the people on your list and build a relationship with those people. If you do things this way they are far more likely to buy something from you in the future such as whatever it is you are promoting. 3 - Promote The Right Product This is where a lot of people go wrong because they abuse their subscriber lists by emailing 100's of different offers. Not only does this confuse the people on their subscriber lists but it also takes advantage of the subscribers trust. It's crucially important that you promote the right product to your list, and stick with that product. I personally promote EZ Money because it's a system I personally use each day to make a full time income. I can stand behind the system 100% because I personally use it, trust it and know that it works because it's making me a lot of money.
