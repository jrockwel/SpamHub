Rules of Success #17 Don't major in minors Don't let little problems upset you. Concentrate on the positives...and the "big picture." Also remember that the only thing that will never change is that there will always be changes (especially in today's rapidly evolving world). Don't let changes upset you. Know that you will have to deal with changes, both big and small, continually. Be prepared to be flexible and to adapt as needed. "Let others lead small lives, but not you. Let others argue over small things, but not you. Let others cry over small hurts, but not you. Let others leave their future in someone else's hands, but not you. Not you." - Jim Rohn "We can no more afford to spend major time on minor things than we can to spend minor time on major things." - Jim Rohn This message has been sent to you by SFI (http://www.sfimg.com/) on behalf of Donna Heavin (donnaheavin@yahoo.com), a member of your SFI Upline Support Team.
