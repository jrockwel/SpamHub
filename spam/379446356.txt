A unique new technology called Infinite Reverse Incremental Backup enables Ocster Backup Pro 8 to create much smaller image backups than other backup solutions. The total size of the backup data is reduced by approximately 50 %! This is possible because the new infinite incremental system only requires a single full backup to ever be made (all following backups are incremental). In contrast, normal incremental systems require two or more full backups, so they take up much more space.
