Our study has several limitations. First, the data may be subject to common method variance as they all came from a unique source. Second, replication in other medical departments is desirable to allow a more accurate appraisal. Third, other factors were not measured and controlled but may have affected the relationship between health literacy and understanding of information e.g., patient participation. Fourth, studies are needed to replicate these findings using alternative measures of health literacy and perceived empathy because different measures may yield different results. Finally, further evaluation on the validity and reliability of the translated questionnaire is highly recommended so as to assure the tools used are reliable and have adequate validity.low healthliteracy levels resulted from never having attended school, or having only attended primary school. As it is not possible to improve literacy levels in a short time, it is worth noting that improving empathic communication skills among healthcare providers can provide a feasible means to increase patients understanding of health information during a visit. Owing to poor health literacy often being associated with a lack of medical knowledge, inferior health status, and a higher use of medical services, efforts ought to be undertaken to address the needs of populations with limited health literacy. With the intention of alteringConclusions A variety of methods have been advocated for communicating with patients who have low literacy skills. Whereas there is abundant research documenting the prevalence of low health literacy and its correlation with insufficient health knowledge, and lessoptimal health outcomes, our study shows that a focus on improving physicianpatient empathy skills could be substantially beneficial in helping to overcome the negative consequences associated with limited healthliteracy capabilities. Dealing with a patient who has low literacy takes time and money. Our study demonstrates that patients with higher perceived empathy exhibited stronger understanding of preoperative information. Healthcare providers who wish to improve the understanding of information by low healthliteracy patients should first identify components of their empathic communication mechanisms, and then try to refine these skills to better serve their patients.Competing interests We certify that the submitted manuscript poses no financial and nonfinancial competing interests over the past five years and for the foreseeable future.
