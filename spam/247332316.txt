How to Create Your Own Bank, Collect 2-10% Interest, Protect Your Assets and Enjoy a Tax-Free Retirement Hi michelle, Mike Dillard here with a surprising update. Last Monday we announced the fourth episode of Elevation Live is happening Thursday evening (tomorrow). The focus will be on Cash Flow Banking, a crucial investment strategy for EVG. And we invited you to submit your questions ahead of time. Well, here comes the surprise.... ...we have NEVER gotten as many questions, so quickly, as we have for this Cash Flow Banking episode. Clearly you are interested in... earning 2-10% interest in this economy protecting your assets from creditors, lawsuits and even ex-spouses getting PAID interest when you borrow money (Yes, when YOU borrow) being protected against a loss of principal using Cash Flow Banking to boost your ROI on all future investments We brought in our EVG expert on Cash Flow Banking to answer our members’ questions... ...but we also want to answer questions for those who are getting ready to join EVG, but haven’t done it yet. Our records say that’s you, michelle.. Here’s a rundown on what you’ll discover TOMORROW NIGHT: Cash Flow Banking is a powerful investment strategy that’s been kept completely under the radar. I had never heard of it when I started The Elevation Group mission. And neither had most of the multi-millionaire investors who I’ve shared this with. But they’re all thanking me now - seriously, I’ve got personal emails to prove it. For me, I’ve used Cash Flow Banking to supercharge my real estate investments, helping me climb above a 40% return. AND it’s set up to provide me and my family a guaranteed income of $100,000 per month starting when I turn 60…all tax-free. And on tomorrow night’s Elevation Live, you’ll find out how you can begin building a tax-free retirement in the amount of your choosing.
