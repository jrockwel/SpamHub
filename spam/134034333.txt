Order Number: 1083706 Date: 29/03/2012 Time: 16:15:15 What happens next? All that is left to do is pack up your items and send them to us. Here's how to do it... Don't forget, the sooner you send in your items, the sooner we can send your cheque. 1. Print Your Welcome Pack We have attached your Welcome Pack to this email and in your Welcome Pack you'll find your FREEPOST labels and your Item List. Having printer trouble? You could always email your Freepost labels to your work email address, and print them out there, or send them to a friend. The Welcome Pack is attached as a PDF, so if you don't already have Adobe Acrobat Reader (which you will need to view and print the attached file), you can download Adobe Acrobat for FREE by clicking here . 2. Pack all your items in a Box Pack all of your CDs, DVDs, or Games in a cardboard box. Each parcel should have no more than 100 items in each box. It is very important to pack all your items into as fewer parcels as possible, this will help us to process your order and send your payment as quickly as possible. Don't forget to include the cases and all the original artwork, as we can't accept your items without them. Please also ensure that for THIS ORDER you use the FREEPOST labels that have this order number 1083706 written on them . If you have more than one order, you will receive a Welcome Pack and different FREEPOST labels for each order. You can identify which FREEPOST labels are for which order by the "order number" that is written on them. If you have a large order and are sending us lots of items, we recommend that you get proof of postage from the Post Office when handing your items to them for posting.
