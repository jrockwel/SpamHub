EVG Update Some Tough Questions Hi Harry, Mike Dillard here.We got a few tough questions from members about tonight’s Elevation Live. I’m going to do my best to get them to our guests tonight...“What if the fair tax is passed? Does this not negate the tax-free status of the Roth? And if it is in fact passed... how does this affect the tax owed on non-Roth accounts?” - George, Port Richey FL“Is there a limit on the total number of self-directed IRA accounts I can set up and fund from my consulting salary and business profits if I’m 100% owner of my own company?” -- Greg, Long Beach, CA“Does your multiple IRA program meet all tax laws & regulations? Do you have documentation stating your program is not considered a target tax shelter by the IRS?” - Rosalie, TNNow -- that last one is definitely a tough question... but I’m positive our guests (who have helped over 142,000 retirement funds since 1974) will be able to answer it for you on the call, Rosalie.Maybe you have some “tough questions” yourself. That’s why you should jump on this call tonight.We’re meeting in six hours and here are your call-in details...(Please remember to keep this information private.This Elevation Live Webcast is for SUBSCRIBERS ONLY).Date: October 16th, 2012Time: 4PM Pacific -- 6PM Central -- 7PM EasternWebcast Address: www.theelevationgroup.com/livePlease note...
