Three provisions in particular would have negative consequences for borderland wildlife. Among the unnecessary measures is the Southern Border Fencing strategy, which threatens to add additional fencing along the border. This additional fencing will not only cost millions of dollars per mile and change flooding routes, but would alter wildlife migration patterns and severe access to vital habitat. Tell your senator that we can have safe borders without fencing in nature! --> Take Action http://therainforestsite.greatergood.com/clickToGive/trs/petition/DOW-BorderWildlifeJeopardy?origin=ETE_062113_DOW-BorderWildlifeJeopardy_F *********** DON'T UPROOT AMERICA'S RAINFOREST The Forest Service is currently debating whether or not to weaken protections for the Tongass National Forest. --> Stay Strong http://therainforestsite.greatergood.com/clickToGive/trs/petition/Earthjustice-SaveAmericasRainforest?origin=ETE_062113_Earthjustice-SaveAmericasRainforest_1 CLEANER FUEL FOR CLEANER AIR Vehicle pollution is still one of the leading causes of smog.
