Can a Startup Take on the Cloud Stars? http://www.idgconnect-resources.com/rt.asp?I=4D011XA421BX2&L=983955 How Do Your Guard Against Cloud Security Risks? http://www.idgconnect-resources.com/rt.asp?I=4D011XA421BX2&L=983956 Do Organisations Know Where Their Data Really Is? http://www.idgconnect-resources.com/rt.asp?I=4D011XA421BX2&L=983957 Cloud computing has gone mainstream. Tempted by the promise of cost reduction, organisations are overthrowing previous concerns over security in favour of the multitude of benefits offered by the Cloud. This week we look at a startup company that aims to compete with Cloud giants such as Google and Amazon, offer a strategy guide to data sovereignty, and brand new analysis into the level of knowledge and fear surrounding data sovereignty in the IT community. Ambition: Nutanix Gains from Demand for Google-like Datacentres Can a startup really compete with the likes of Facebook, Google and Amazon?

So whose laws is your data subject to? Where a Cloud provider's data centers reside affects which nation, state, or locality has legal sovereignty over and thus potential access to that data. Understand the risks, and how to mitigate them - read this white paper. http://www.idgconnect-resources.com/rt.asp?I=4D011XA421BX2&L=983959 Analysis: Knowledge and Fear Surrounding Data Sovereignty The Cloud, despite its aura of intangibility, is still a physical server hosted somewhere. Each country has their own data laws, all varying in strength and in regard to issues such as privacy and security. Do organizations know where their Cloud is hosted, and more importantly, who has legal access to it in that country? Featuring a survey of over 200 business & IT professionals from 42 countries, this new report from IDG Connect looks at awareness of Data Sovereignty and concerns surrounding the issue.
