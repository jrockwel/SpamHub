The previous owner had pads and rotors replaced twice in the front and once in the back. When I purchased the vehicle at 70,000 miles the one thing I noticed was that although it was shifting smooth it would shift between 3,000 - 4,000 RPM. I threw it up on a lift and noticed that the right front caliper was locked up. Seeing it had white discoloration from heat on both front calipers I replaced them and the pads. A week later the right front caliper is locking up again. Has anyone heard of similar problems with that make or model or have any idea what could be causing the problem?

There's another thread running here about that problem on a Buick. Measure it with a micrometer; cut it with an ax. 05-14-13, 08:06 AM #3 brewcityc's Avatar brewcityc brewcityc is offline Member Join Date Aug 2007 State: WI Posts 164 Is that something you can tell by looking at it? I checked that and didn't see anything apparent wrong with that. 05-14-13, 09:03 AM #4 gray2863 gray2863 is offline Member Join Date May 2013 State: NC Posts 3 yeah im the one with the buick we are going to try tonight and see if it is the hose ill post back and let yall know we have replaced the caliper,brakes,rotor, and abs pump and for some reason we didnt replace the line we know better but things happen...save money i think we spent a lot of money we didnt need to 05-14-13, 09:14 AM #5 brewcityc's Avatar brewcityc brewcityc is offline Member Join Date Aug 2007 State: WI Posts 164 Thanks. I appreciate that. I know I've heard one other person mention the ABS pump or possibly a proportional valve. I'll wait to hear how changing out the hoses works out for you. 05-14-13, 11:07 AM #6 DMCman DMCman is offline Member Join Date Aug 2012 State: MD Posts 90 I found a way to test for a plugged hose (my 2005 Malibu had one). Just undo the hose end on the caliper, if if does not drain fluid from the open end, it's plugged. Mine was plugged where they crimped a holding bracket around the hose. It would work the brake but not relase sometimes. 05-14-13, 01:31 PM #7 the_tow_guy's Avatar the_tow_guy the_tow_guy is online now Group Moderator Join Date Feb 2001 State: FL Posts 10,767 Yep, that'll do it. Cracking the bleeder will do it, too. Really not a visual inspection you can make as the failure is the internal wall of the hose that deteriorates. Measure it with a micrometer; cut it with an ax. 05-14-13, 01:36 PM #8 2granddaughters's Avatar 2granddaughters 2granddaughters is offline Member Join Date Jun 2010 State: CANADA Posts 176 When you say that the caliper is locked up do you mean that the wheel is hard to turn when the car is off the ground? Is the rotor scored? 05-14-13, 01:48 PM #9 AMY FIX 62 AMY FIX 62 is offline Member Join Date Feb 2013 State: NY Posts 159 Brewcityc, Flex hose brake issues are common, but not on your particular vehicle. Reason being is that the Residual Brake Line Fluid Pressure and Running Brake Line Fluid pressure are great enough (at all times) to keep any brake hose from collapsing on to itself. Your problem is a defective Brake Caliper. Whats happening here is that the Caliper Piston is failing to retract all the way back into its bore. As a result the brake pads are staying in constant contact with the rotor and causing the brakes to drag. The failure for the retraction could be due to dirt, rust, moisture, seals, mechanical (and or) any combination of the mentioned. Depending on your level of skill you can try to Rebuild the caliper. If you decide to replace Raybestos brake parts and accessories is all I use. Visit the link below.

The colapsed brake hose will expand when you give it brake pressure but it will not relase and hold the pads on the rotor. 05-14-13, 03:36 PM #11 PJmax's Avatar PJmax PJmax is offline Forum Topic Moderator Join Date Oct 2012 State: NJ Posts 4,450 A little off topic..... I tried rebuilding several brake calipers. For the cost of a factory rebuilt.....it doesn't pay to mess around. + Reply to Thread Previous Thread | Next Thread Posting Permissions You may not post new threads You may not post replies You may not post attachments You may not edit your posts BB code is On Smilies are On [IMG] code is On HTML code is Off Trackbacks are On Pingbacks are On Refbacks are On All times are GMT -7.
