And it's all come down to a bureaucratic squabble over whether the money is subject to so-called sequestration because of the year it was paid -- 2013 -- as the Obama administration contends, or exempt from the cuts because of the year it was generated -- 2012 -- as the states insist.Right now, it's a standoff heightened by history and hard fiscal realities. But with taxpayer cash scarce, both sides are digging in: The Forest Service has to slash 5 percent of its budget under sequestration. The states, meanwhile, have depended for decades on a share of revenue from timber cut on federal land. Perhaps least willing to compromise are members of Congress who are up for re-election next year and are loath to let go of money that benefits potential voters back home.It's not clear who gets to decide or whether the question ends up in court.

This upgraded version has not yet been dropped from a plane."It gives us a far greater capability to reach and destroy an enemy's weapons of mass destruction that are located in well protected underground facilities... to a magnitude far greater than we have now," Pentagon Spokesman Capt. John Kirby said.Kirby denied the bombs are designed to target Iran, even though it is the only country known to have buried its nuclear weapons program."The system is not aimed at any one country, it's to develop a capability we believe we need," Kirby said. That remark was met by audible groans and various comments of disbelief from the Pentagon press corps.Boeing successfully tested the bomb on March 17, 2007 at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.Pentagon Spokesma
