Our setup is great because it is totally unique, high energy, and fun. We provide entertainment in a way that a traditional photo booth never could  - mid-air jumps, 10+ people fit in a photo, fashion photo quality - while still providing your guests with an awesome take-home souvenir. Or for a smaller footprint, check out our brand new Photo Party Station. Our Photosphere360 setup is the only one of it's kind in the world. Photosphere360 snaps branded 360-degree photos at parties and events that are also turned into interactive movies allowing users to click and drag the picture to see all the action! The interactive movies can be branded then linked to Facebook, Myspace, and emailed, allowing your guests to do viral marketing for you. Click here to check out a video of Photosphere360 in action!

Our unique iPad Backpack holds an iPad in front of the photographer so that she can roam around your photo taking photos of guests on the dance floor, red carpet, and beyond. Photos instantly appear on the iPad so that guests can upload them instantly to Facebook, Twitter, and Email. 3) The Photo Party Station - The Photo Party Station is super sleek alternative to a photo booth. A touchscreen mounted in a slick housing makes for an awesome photo booth experience open to the entire party while only taking up about 1 foot square.  With options to upload to social media as well as instant printing this is a great solution for a tight space. We use your party as the background of the photos. Add a fisheye lens for a funky-MTV look. Please give me a call so that we can discuss the option that works best for you.
