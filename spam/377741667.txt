  The White House, Washington Hi, all! This week, we got some big news about the immigration reform bill. It's a little wonky, but it's so great that I couldn't wait to share it with you. The nonpartisan experts who estimate the financial impact of legislation for Congress concluded that because undocumented immigrants will start paying more in taxes for things like education and Social Security, the immigration proposal in the Senate will make the economy fairer for middle class families while cutting the U.S. deficit by almost $1,000,000,000,000 over the next two decades. With every passing day, it’s becoming clear that we can’t afford not to act. Now we know exactly how much is at stake, and it's the kind of news that can help to change the policy conversation in Washington. *So we've put together a graphic that explains exactly how this works, and we need your help to share it. *If more people get the facts, it'll be easier to build a nationwide, bipartisan consensus to get this done. *Take a look, then share this graphic with folks you know: [ http://www.whitehouse.gov/share/1trillion#graphic?utm_source=email&utm_medium=social&utm_content=061913p1&utm_campaign=immigration ]* According to the CBO, immigration reform will save us nearly 1 trillion dollars.
