Submission Works is Empower Network's #1 way to enroll new Members. Period. I'm getting a tonne of emails from y'all and the MOST frequently asked question would have to be: "Will Submission Works work to promote my Empower Network affiliate links?" Simple question. Simple answer. YES! -- http://www.Submission-Works.com --> I get at least 10-12 emails from Submission Works members EVERY day and the best success stories come from Empower Network Members. People are getting 100% commissions on a daily basis in EN thanks to promoting their links with Submission Works. Can you handle these simple steps? 1. Signup 2. Login and click the "add URL's" page. 3. Save 1-7 of your best links on this page (SW converts traffic for ANY type of link) That's it people. Super simple to get started and use. But does Submission Works traffic convert? My advanced testing says YES. Yesterday my conversion rate of hits to sales was 2.7% 2013's biggest launch is just a click away :) Join now: -- http://www.Submission-Works.com --> Over n' Out...
