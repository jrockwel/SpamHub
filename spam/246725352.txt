sometimes I feel like their food leaves something to be desired For instance, sometimes I feel like their beet and avocado salad is a little too bland And their crazy corn app was just way too salty I wasnt too wowed by their fries either BUT, they have this one drink, the Bramble, that I still think about (Hm Id really love one right now) And, the first entree I ate there, the duck breast on polenta, was heavenly HEAVENLY I also love the ambiance, and for the most part, the waitstaff is excellent Im also a sucker for any sort of local and seasonal restaurant They have an outdoor patio, which is great for those nice balmy days, although its sort of in a random location for an outdoor patio I suppose its supposed to give it more of a New York or European sidewalk cafe sort of feel, but even though I like the patio, I still think its super random And dessert They always seem to be out of ice cream cake when I go there, but the ONE time they had it, it was so super delicious that I was definitely wishing that I hadnt chosen to share it with friends Besides the ice cream cake, they always have a fruit tart (not so impressive just a tasteless tart shell with some lemon curd topped with unglazed fluit) and bread pudding all using seasonal flavors Anyways, Ill most definitely be back, but Im just starting to think that the prices dont completely warrant the food As in, some of their food is most definitely worth the price, but some plates are a little of a miss Listed in: SLC restaurant faves Was this review Useful (2) (1) Cool (5) Add owner comment Bookmark Send to

lemon flavor on the outside and nice creamy ricotta inside Pretty delicioso The escarole salad was basic My wife loved it I was satisfied but not super impressed We both had the chicken cordon bleau sandwich which was pretty damn good for a chicken sandwich It was hot and the cheese was nicely melted and the ham was perfect I added a little salt as I do almost on everything Well definitely be

Checkin Here Amazing I got the Carbonara, mainly because of the way the waitress described it I just had to try it I loved it, the gooeyness of the egg was just perfect the flavors literally exploded in my mouth I couldnt even pick out all the flavors For dessert I consumed the banana split The ice cream tasted homemade the sauces were amazing and just the right proportions I really hate when the sauce over powers the ice cream The best part was the pistachio brittle sprinkled over it all This was by far the best banana split I have consumed in my life I was here with a large group of other yelpers and got the chance to try several of the desserts, really there was not one that I didnt like To top off the evening the service was amazing, we got there a couple minutes before our reservation and the table was ready for us (we had a group of over ten) The waitress was awesome and patient with our large group I would s milky and buttery and flavored with just enough of the smoky bacon bits �She chose the bean salad for the side and it was different, but good �Im going to steal the idea and make my own bean salad with olive oil and balsamic :) The server was attentive, but I was a bit putoff when I overheard her telling another table of the specials when we werent offered that same information before we ordered Overall, excellent food and atmosphere (though it was a *bit* chilly in there) � I liked that water was served from little bottles �Cute �And the setup was crisp with a nice view of the food preparations �Id return Was this review Useful (1) � Cool � Add owner

I thought they did a great job with getting us inout and serving up light lunch fare that didnt leave us feeling like we needed a Thanksgiving nap after our meal I had the Pulled Pork sandwich and ordered a side of Broccoli �All the food served met the eyeball test and looked amazing The server was friendly, prompt, and helpful and the bill came to just under 30 for two of us for lunch Based on

Tong F 7 friends 18 reviews Tong F Salt Lake City, UT 9112011 I like Copper Onion very much The atmosphere is casual and relaxed, and the staff is friendly and service is fast My favorite dish is the pork belly salad The pork tastes like its stewed with soy sauce and spices and then fried Very good There are also seasonal local ingredients in other dishes that I like to try The prices sometimes seem high, but the food is good Was this review Useful (1) � Cool � Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This Review Review from Chris 7 friends 30 reviews Chris Fremont, CA 10122010

super picky Small restaurant mistakes drive me crazy Copper onion hit EVERY note To start, arugula salad Perfectly fresh, with just the right amount of seasoning Dressed with olive oil and lemon (I think) YUM �Next it was steak for two with our choice of three sides The rib eye steak was great and came with a chimi churri and a romesco sauce The three sides, grilled snap peas, broccoli rabe, and a pepper dish It was perfect, the cooking, the freshness, the seasoning Onto desert?

Pleasant, UT 332012 Lets get to the heart of things a casual, but friendly atmosphere; prime, locally sourced ingredients; a knowledgable and friendly staff that brings you drinks while you wait for a table (its Friday night and youre on the fly) and then amiably indulges you and your four friends (thanks, Rob), who have shared one too many bottles of Sean Minor Four Bears Cabernet Sauvignon and are getting a tiny bit rowdy �One friend describes the meal as magical and gives a jazz hands hallelujah every time she brings a bite of perfectly cooked duck breast to her lips �Two other friends promise to marry each other, if only they can keep eating the mushroom appetizer with tiny, crunchy, beautiful potato sticks and lush, melting egg �Another friend sings the praises of the finely sliced Brussels sprouts, seasoned to tempt even the most vehement haters of the flowering cabbage family �We at the table shared everything we ate �(I did try to siphon off the Broadway dessert cocktail a root beer float kicked up with Sambuca by myself unsuccessfully) �We got a bit feisty, but managed to settle our bills without being forcibly ejected by the popo �It was glorious and wonderful �Do yourself a favor and stop by you wont be disappointed Was this review Useful (2) � Cool (2) Add owner comment Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This Review Review from Georgie M 7 friends 30 reviews Georgie M Seattle, WA 6142011 1 Checkin Here One of the best things that can happen when you are on the road is to accidentally come across a restaurant that totally excites all your tastebuds and leaves you with the joyous feeling of having founds something totally awesome Such a build up for this review is apt as this is exactly the feeling I walked out of Copper Onion after my dinner The restaurant is new American food at its best with some really interesting Italian elements to the menu that gives you the flexibility of having an extra option while you are contemplating on what to order For myself, considering I had an appetite building up through a full day of being on the road and my on foot touristy escapade of trying to see the must see places in downtown Salt Lake City, I started with an appetizer plate of bone marrow, parsley, radish and chared baguette, later for the main course I went for the pasta carbonara, then came the desert which for me was tiramisu and finally I rounded of my dinner with a dessert cocktail called the after dinner mint The appetizer was unique and tasted great with the smooth and silky texture of the marrow contrasting well with the crispness of the radish and the punch of the rock salt Similarly when dinner came the saltiness of the bacon blended very well with the softness of the pasta and the gooiness of the egg So far so good and I was already sold on the restaurant Then came the dessert and boy did it make my night even better The tiramisu was delectably delicious and to top it all there was the dessert cocktail which was one of the freshest drinks I have had Icecream mixed with alcohol gave the cocktail such a refreshingly fresh twist The staff and service at the restaurant perfectly complemented the fabulous food by being really friendly, patient and welcoming As a result I was not left feeling like an out of towner The waiter struck up a lively conversation with me and this made the meal a lot more enjoyable as I did not feel like I was being left all alone Finally the bill came and with the tip I cam out of the place paying less than 50 bucks which was well worth the priceless feeling of coming out of a restaurant totally content with the meal that you have just had Listed in: My adventures with food Was this review Useful (1) � Cool (1) Add owner comment Bookmark

to eat very often, we usually cook at home We were both craving a burger and decided to try Copper Onion Honestly,after the first bite,we couldnt stop Once we were done looking like straight up cave people devouring our burgers, we then had to talk about them for the nect ten minutesit was not just a meal,but an experience my boyfriend got the steak fries and I got the arugula salad The salad was great,perfect portion My boyfriend loved his fried, as did I, he just said he wishes they had given him a few more If you love red wine, get the layer cake malbecbest malbec Ive ever had Service was also great, had a sweet waitress who was very attentive We usually go for the cheesecake or chocolatey type desserts but we wanted to try something different so we went with the almond butter cake I wouldnt recommend sharing this dessert as it was a bit small, but it still satisfied our sweet tooth We cant wait to go again and try something else off the menu Was this review Useful � � Cool � Add
