 Avaaz.org - The World in Action Dear friends, In hours, Uganda could pass a law that could impose the death penalty for homosexuality . An international outcry shelved this bill last year -- we urgently need to ramp up the pressure to press President Museveni to stand up for human rights and stop this brutal law. Sign below, and tell everyone: The Ugandan Parliament is set to pass a brutal law that could carry the death penalty for homosexuality. If they do, thousands of Ugandans could face execution -- just for being gay . We've helped stop this bill before, and we can do it again. After a massive global outcry last year, Ugandan President Museveni blocked the bill's progress. But political unrest is mounting in Uganda, and religious extremists in Parliament are hoping confusion and violence in the streets will distract the international community from a second push to pass this hate-filled law. We can show them that the world is still watching . We have no time to lose. Let’s get one million voices against Uganda's gay death penalty in the next 24 hours -- we'll deliver it to Uganda's leaders and key countries. Click here to take action , then forward this email to everyone: http://www.avaaz.org/en/uganda_stop_gay_death_law/?bRMUmcb&v=19438 Being gay in Uganda is already dangerous and terrifying. LGBT Ugandans are regularly harassed and beaten, and just last year gay rights activist David Kato (pictured above) was brutally murdered in his own home. Now they are threatened by this draconian law which could impose life imprisonment for people convicted of same-sex relations, and the death penalty for “serial offenders” . Even NGOs working to prevent the spread of HIV can be imprisoned for “promoting homosexuality” under this hate-filled law. Right now, Uganda is in political turmoil -- missing millions of aid money has embroiled the Parliament in scandal. This upheaval has provided religious extremists in Parliament the perfect chance to slip in the shelved anti-gay bill , calling it a "Christmas gift" to Ugandans. President Museveni backed away from this bill before, after international pressure threatened Uganda's support. Let's build a million strong petition to stop the gay death penalty bill again, and save lives. We only have hours -- sign below, then tell friends and family: http://www.avaaz.org/en/uganda_stop_gay_death_law/?bRMUmcb&v=19438 Last time, our international petition condemning the gay death penalty law was delivered to Parliament – spurring a global news story and enough pressure to block the bill for months. When a tabloid newspaper published 100 names, pictures and addresses, of suspected gays and those identified were threatened, Avaaz supported a legal case against the paper and we won! Together we have stood up, time and time again, for Uganda’s gay community -- now they need us more than ever. With hope and determination, Emma, Iain, Alice, Luis, Ricken, Joseph, Michelle and the whole Avaaz team MORE INFORMATION Kadaga wants anti-gay Bill tabled (Daily Monitor) http://www.monitor.co.ug/News/National/Kadaga-wants-anti-gay-Bill-tabled/-/688334/1621218/-/j0h230z/-/index.html Ugandan Parliament to debate anti-gay bill (AFP) http://au.news.yahoo.com/world/a/-/world/15453168/ugandan-parliament-to-debate-anti-gay-bill/ Order paper Tuesday 20th November 2012 (Parliament of Uganda) http://www.scribd.com/doc/114102346/PARLIAMENT-OF-UGANDA-Order-paper-Tuesday-20th-November-2012 Pulling Out All the Stops to Push an Antigay Bill (New York Times) http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/world/africa/14uganda.html Support the Avaaz Community!
