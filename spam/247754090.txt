Pogoplug (https://pogoplug.com/) Get unlimited cloud storage for free (http://pogoplug.extole.com/m/1912789616?email=scooter@dispostable.com) Hi Pogoplug users, Today I’m excited to announce the next generation of referral program. Pogoplug has offered you incentives for telling friends about us before, but this one beats anything out there: When you spread the word about Pogoplug Cloud, you get a free month of unlimited cloud storage for every friend who creates a free account. Other services offer a little storage at a time, or reward only after purchase, but because we believe in no strings and no limits, we’re giving everyone a chance to get as much storage as they need for zero cost. (http://pogoplug.extole.com/m/1912789616?email=scooter@dispostable.com) Here’s how it works: 1. Tell your friends about Pogoplug Cloud via email, Twitter, Facebook, or on your own website using a unique referral link (http://pogoplug.extole.com/m/1912789616?email=scooter@dispostable.com) . 2. Your friends get free 7GB cloud accounts. 3. Pogoplug credits your account with a free month for every friend who signs up. A good deal for everyone: * No purchase required. * Earn up to 12 months at a time and top up as you go. * Friends get 7GB forever instead of the usual 5GB—just for knowing you. Try it for yourself (http://pogoplug.extole.com/m/1912789616?email=scooter@dispostable.com) and start earning unlimited cloud storage, absolutely free. As always, we enjoy hearing from you.
