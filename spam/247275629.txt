 Attn My Dear Friend , I have been waiting for you since to contact me for your Cash Fund of $2.7 Million Dollars but I did not hear from you since then therefore because of the impossibility of your fund transfer through Western Union and Money Gram Office, I have credited your total sum of $2.7 Million into an ATM CARD and I want and registered the ATM CARD with FedEx Express Company for safety purpose meanwhile you are advice to contact the FedEx Express company with your delivery address. Note: I have paid for the shipping fee except their security keeping charge of $95 which I wanted to pay them but they said no because they don't know when you will contact them in case of demur rage. So you are to pay the security keeping charge of $95.00usd as soon as you contact them. The following is the Contact Information of the FedEx Express Service Company Email Address online : (fedexcourierservice1c1@yahoo.com) Tel: +229-9878-5325 Contact them today and also send them the security official keeping charge to avoid increase of their fees and let me know once you receive your ATM card.

(3) YOUR DIRECT PHONE NUMBER........ (4) YOUR CURRENT OFFICE TELEPHONE......... (5) YOUR COUNTRY ................ (6) A COPY OF YOUR PICTURE............ so that they will deliver your ATM Card to your home address immediately.
