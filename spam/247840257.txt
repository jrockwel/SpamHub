Factors that are considered in determining voice type include voice we687aca8bbfa8c67a682e449a1ede6dabht, timbre, color, range and texture. If you are a man, your voice is either that of a bass, baritone, countertenor or tenor. If you are a woman, you may either be a contralto, mezzo soprano or a soprano. Knowing your voice type will enable you to l2601402_2E449425594rn the techniques that are specifically suited for you.

You know you are singing correctly if you are using an open voice. In this form, the notes flow effortlessly and with minimal strain. You are using a closed voice if it croaks, cracks or if there is too much strain in your throat. Ask your vocal coach to check if you are using an open or closed voice.
