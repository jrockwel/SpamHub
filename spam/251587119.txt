some reason I have a hard time finding place that serve this dish The corned beef tasted fine but man was it watery I had a puddle of water on my plate I guess they dont drain the bbage when they plate The corned beef was ok Not the greatest and certainly not what I was expecting from such a well known deli This was a disappointing meal I wouldnt bother to come back Too far from where I live and not worth the hassle Was this � � owner Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Edward C Edward C San Jose The garde manger here must keep roundtheclock hours to keep the deli se full The menu is an encyclopedia of offerings You could literally eat every day in this dimly lit coffee shop lounge environment and in an entire year not have everything on the menu Don't order the coffee here unless you are desperate Other than that the place is a rnal haven of delight Was this � � � owner Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from bran p bran p Los Angeles Oh nter's how I do love thee especially after a night of heavy drinking and The OC reruns � The avodo melt is the most vegetarian friendly sauteed mushroom bit of goodness this side of heaven �A pickle is a pickle is a pickle but the pickles here are PICKLES �I don't know what I mean by that but I mean that they're good When I was a rnivore I loved the monte cristo �They still serve the monte cristo �It's not just a great book but also a divine sandwich Eat it �Just tell them to hold the turkey and the ham � It's chill low key and absolutely perfect for a late night craving �Hell it's open hours �Damn them Was this owner

HIGH in my sandwich I actually had to take out some of the meat and eat it as a side beuse my jaw couldn't open that big Sooo delicious especially with a side of fries I'm definitely gonna stop by here again when I visit Interesting side note: Jonah Hill Seth from Superbad was standing outside this place when I visited Puhretty if you ask me Was this owner Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Oren G Oren G Los Angeles photo Checkins Here There just ain't nuthin' like a steaming bowl of nter's mishmosh in the wee hours of the morning It's damned near a religious experience Many here rightly ll nter's an La institution Originally founded in East La back in its Jewish days nter's moved to Fairfax to become the hub of the district I've been here hundreds of times over the past + years and have never had a disappointing meal The pastrami and corned beef are piled high and succulent the pickles are homemade and perfectly seasoned and the corned beef hash for breakfast or after a late night n move one to tears The fact that many of their waitstaff have that grandmotherly appeal sure doesn't hurt nter's Deli Try it Was this owner Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Abel a Abel a Los Angeles Say it with me OVERRATED clapclapclap OVERRATED clapclapclap Seriously people I think that we are brainwashed with the reputation and history of this place It is a Hollywood landmark Perhaps I'm not being fair But When I was an omnivore I had their sandwiches and matzo or whatever soup I wasn't impressed at all Kind of bland I think it's just the hype Was this owner Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Victor K Victor K Los Angeles The first time I me to nter's I ordered the avodo and swiss sandwich or something like that while the rest of my group ordered various kinds of reubens Don't get me wrong the sandwich I ordered was very good but all I could do that meal was stare in envy at the rest of my table So the next time I went I made sure to order a reuben Zomg I'm usually the kind of guy that has to try EVERYTHING on the menu atleast once Of the ten or so times I've gone to nter's since I have only ordered the corned beef reuben Yar it's that fookin delicious The corned beef is so piled on I always have to make the corny joke "would you like some sandwich with your corned beef" XD Anyway I'm not going to go on and on about how the delite balance of spices and ingredients tantalizes my tongue and feels as if a rainbow is spewing forth from my mouth and eyes no all I'm going to say is that if you live close do yourself a favor and go try it In fact don't wait Do it now Why aren't you doing it now Pfft fine lame asses Since you're all so intent on finishing my I'll talk about the service and stuff I guess Oh but before that the pickles If you like pickles this place has amazing ones They serve you pickles sort of like how other places will serve you bread before a meal Yar even the pickles are that amazing Oh and they've got their own brand of mustard that's so good I n eat anything with it And I mean anything pears pineapples whatever put that mustard on it and I'll eat it Okay service this is where I had to take away a point from this place The waiters aren't quite the brightest crayons in the box Here's the dialogue from when one of my buddies tried to order a sandwich "I want a blah blah blah on sourdough" "Oh sorry we don't have any sourdough here" "Uhhh yes you do" "No We don't" "I come here ALL THE TIME yes you do" "Ohhhh The sourdough" "Yes on sourdough" "Well you know our dough isn't all that sour so" And no the waiter guy wasn't kidding He was dead serious rtman face The one waiter I've had that was good Is the kramer looking guy when he's having a good day but if you tch him when he's not having a good day that guy is srier than a woman scorned Anyway to wrap this thing up from a sle of om to OM NOM NOM NOM the ps count as a point XD I give this place an OM NOM NOM NO Yar I had to take away the "M" cos of the service God I'm so heartless Was this owner Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Terry S Terry S Los Angeles Great for sandwiches and delistaples This place is an institution here Always busyalways consistent Food is good nothing outstanding and nothing bad The sandwiches are huge and you n get pretty much anything you want with a huge selection of the typil deli components Was this owner Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Joshua S Joshua S Santa Clara It isn't the Stage Ratners Katz or even the Rasl House RIP but it is a dam good deli and the best one on the west coast Nothing like it in the Bay Area Good for star watching after last ll Was this owner Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Alex N Alex N Los Angeles nter's tastes pretty good at AM when you've just started sobering up after a night of barhopping Any other time however I'm not so sure Its authentic deli feel and 's decor are inviting but things start to fall apart once you sit down The booths ocsionally have ripped vinyl seats sometimes repaired with duct tape while the nonbooth tables have really uncomfortable old chairs Unless you're willing to drop on one of their deli sandwiches everything else on the menu which is a mess btw is your typil diner fare You'd be just as happy eating at a Denny's The last time I was here I didn't want to spend more than on a latenight meal but still wanted something that would give me that authentic deli taste So I ordered the Matzo ball soup It was essentially just a ball of packed bread crumbs in a bowl of some kind of broth The soup itself had no tasteit might as well have been salt water The matzo ball tasted just how it looked stale and dry Even after it had soaked up most of the broth it still managed to taste dry I'm really not sure why we eat here Was this owner Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from colleen b colleen b Redondo Beach Checkin Here WOW My family and I me for a late lunch and the owner was there and treated my daughters like royalty After the yummy lunch the owner gave us a complimentary plate of rugelach which was the perfect end to a filling lunch I started with a knish which of us shared and then moved onto The Brooklyn which is pastrami on rye with coleslaw on top of the pastrami It was fantastic We ordered some corn beef to go and stopped at the bakery on the way out again more complimentary cookies I love that none of the homemade breadssweets have any perservatives so eat it within a few days The only draw back my girls' had stomach aches on the way home Was this owner Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Adam W Elite ' Adam W Los Angeles I don't even know why I bother writing of these firmly entrenched LA establishments that already have hundreds of Nonetheless I feel like it's my duty as a native New Yorker to weigh in I guess this is really for New Yorkers and people who use Russian dressing as a condiment I should note from the getgo that nter's is not a kosher deli it is a kosherSTYLE deli they serve distinctly nonkosher foods like cheeseburgers for example like the rnegie Deli Speaking of nter's is not as good as the rnegie Deli or even the nd Ave Deli It's more like a Stage Deli But it's totally legit in every possible way The sandwiches are nowhere near as big as rnegie's and their pastrami is not as good But the guys from Broadway Danny Rose would assuredly eat here when gigging out west When I go to nter's I feel like I'm home I n't put my finger on it beuse the decor is so blah Those old phone jacks at the tables and that bizarre balcony thing it's anachronistic but it's lovable like a jukebox or drivein I think it's the just the overwhelming aura of corned beef matzah balls fresh rugelach and Dr Brown's There's a Junior's here in LA on Westwood As a Brooklynite I had to go but it really doesn't measure up in fact the Juniors in Brooklyn isn't so great to begin with And Izzy's was really disappointing So nter's is really the one that stands out to me among all the kosherstyle delis in La The last time I was there a prostitute who had a striking resemblance to Jacke Harry bolted through the door and grabbed a bag off the bakery counter and said "I almost forgot my hamantashen" So take comfort in knowing it's the number source for hooker hamantashen at AM With an endorsement like that how n you go wrong One small criticism: one of the shiers was extremely rude to a cousin of mine who was visiting from NY She bought a nters tshirt as a souvenir for a friend size small and the shier looked her up and down and had the nerve to say "I think you'll need a larger size" So that basilly ruined her entire experience The girl just ate chicken soup a Reuben and a knish and you're going to make her selfconscious about her weight Un dude So be reful of that one "bitchy" male shier otherwise the service is fine Was this owner Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Nick P Elite ' Nick P Kirkland WA Checkin Here A reason to fall in love with LA again I started going here about years ago and even then it was THE place to be in the evening after a night of partying My favorite place to sit has always been the middle room so adorned with 's style recordlookingthingies on the walls Lately however I've been eating in the main dining room the same room used in a recent rl's Jr commercial Finally don't forget the Kibitz Room a fun place to hang out on a weekend evening when they have live music The food is mediocre and the service n be horrendous some of the waitresses may very well be as old as the restaurant itself but the atmosphere is the reason to go You just feel like you're in a 's La Listed in: Look sweety let's nosh ok Was this owner Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Ken K Elite ' Ken K La Habra Maybe it was beuse I had low expectations but I really enjoyed the Brooklyn Ave pastrami sandwich here Why did I have low expectations I've come to frown upon thinlysliced pastrami beuse I've been spoiled by the handcut pieces at Katz's and Langer's From my experiences handcut equals juicy and thinsliced usually equals dry chewy gristly andor too fatty and this is coming from someone who LOVES fat But at nter's the pastrami is just about as juicy and rich in flavor as the ones at the aforementioned places and I like the hard crust on the rye bread I know I'm being high maintenance about this but hey I want to ENJOY what I eat and I know you do too So take my advice and eat here or at Langer's if you want good pastrami It boggles my mind when people say they love The Hat; I shudder at the thought of eating there And it's a definite plus that nter's is open around the clock I'm not usually out late but it's nice to know I have an option for good food should I ever need it at three in the morning BTW we unknowingly entered through the north end next to some night clubbar and were seated right up against the wall adjacent to that bar while some band was blasting away Needless to say it was loud If you'd prefer a quieter scene I'd recommend you enter through the south end or at least request to be seated in the next room over since this restaurant is quite spacious Overrated and overpriced I find most of the food to be bland especially the stuffed potato The strawberry cheeseke was downright offensive Its convenient beuse its open hours but some of the late night servers are quite rude and rush us I do love the pickles though Was this � � � owner Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Liz X Liz X Chigo IL While nter's rocks for so many reasons and is very good especially if you need your New York deli fix it's not the BEST deli in LA that honor goes to Langer's in my book �Although it is pretty damn goodespecially at in the morning when you and your friend just happen to notice it on your way home from a debauched night out on the town � I always go for the pastrami beuse that's just what you get when you go to a NY style deli �The pickles are crispy and crunchy and are a bit more garlicy and not quite as pickled and sour as most deli pickles �But that makes them that much better �And the stale bagel chips �Now I know you're thinking to yourself "why would anyone ever eat stale bagel chips" �But you're only thinking that to yourself beuse you're sober right now The matzo ball soupkreplach gets a whole paragraph to itself �YUMMM And counterintuitively filling as well �Get ityou won't regret it � The best part about nter's besides the harvest gold orange and brown decors motif is the staff �The servers are these old ladies who look at all the Hollywood hipsters drunk kids and homeless dudes with disdain �You half expect them to be wearing a pink outfit with a white apron skirt smacking gum and telling you to "kiss my grits" as they slap your plate on the table �You gotta love it One more thing nter's was featured on a "Curb Your Enthusiasm" episode where Larry is sitting with a bunch of adults with Down's syndrome after a rwash fundraiserhilarious �That makes me love it even more Was this owner Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Jerry H Jerry H Durham NC Once you get passed the long line nter's makes me feel like I'm on the Upper West Side Sans the tripped out ceiling a joint where you know the Reuben's bomb and the garlic infused pickles will do you right The Corned Beef is piled on and cut to order everything's fresh and you will love it The history is on the walls literally Throughout the upstairs and downstairs there's all sorts of newspaper magazine clippings to let you know this place is where you should be for the Jewish Deli experience Our waiter was zany kooky just how a waiter in La should be Was this � � owner Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Josh L Josh L Studio City I haven't been to nter's on over years �Man I was shocked at how the prices have freakin' shot up though �There's not much on the menu for under �I'm a cheap bastard so when I was there last night with a buddy of mine I was immediately biased I love sandwiches I love delis and I especially love NYJewish delis �nter's is that but throw some LA into it �I orderd the 'Danny Thomas' beuse I like salami and Danny Thomas For you get a salami sandwich between two slices of smallish sized rye bread a small cup of cole slaw and a few pickles �You do get a ton of meat though but when I say t ton I don't mean a ton in regards to Jewish delis that's pretty much standardand the salami was really good too I have to say I was satisfied but I don't think it should have been �I truthfully think that all the prices should be knocked down �They are good and it is an LA landmark but one of two things has to happen to make it great: �The prices should be a little lower or the food should be EVEN better It would have been great to see this place in it's hay day �It seems that this place lives on more for it's history than it's present existence �I'm not dogging that but it's awesome if a place n be legendary in it's current time I'm not loving it �Only liking it �I think my only reason for coming back here in the future would be if I was out in Hollywood at am and needed foodeven then there are other options �It's good but not great Was this � � owner Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Ed C Ed C Los Angeles Ditto on what everyone else has written

Bookmark Send to a Friend Link to This from Amy S Amy S Los Angeles When it's late when you've been drinking when you're wandering the city hoping food will appear someone will eventually say "well there's always nter's" And you hem and you haw and sometimes you just end up here It happens Their food's okay It's nothing spectacular but it's nothing awful I'm a sucker for blintzes so I'm always happy But why is it so freaking expensive It's mediocre deli food Mediocre deli food should NOT cost so much Regardless though I am glad they're always an option Was this owner Bookmark Send to a
