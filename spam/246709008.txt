 Any date is better than just watching TV alone and crying yourself to sleep, right? With me you will forget television even exist, you have my word! I'm the sort of hot date your friends bragged about and perhaps your family warned you against. Mostly, I'm in no mood for tearjerker movies. But I do enjoy some nasty action which will make you shed a tear or two of happiness! See if you can cope with me, fellow. Bet you'll like my flirty photographs right here , too! Let's do it!
