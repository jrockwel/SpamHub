One is your training wheels and the other is your sparkly tassels: How to achieve freewheeling awesomeness with in-app private and public notes. ------------------------------------------------------------ http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=adfa3190f365a81690030bbe1&id=002d6eedcb&e=36f2d28b4e http://www.haikudeck.com?utm_source=Haiku+Deck+Account+Holders&utm_campaign=002d6eedcb-Notes6_19_2013&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_16b8d96520-002d6eedcb-320800917 Hi there friend of Haiku Deck, Our friend Nancy Duarte, the amazingly talented slide designer and author of slide:ology, once said that getting used to presenting your slides without reading them word for word is like learning to ride a bike without training wheels. Our new in-app private notes, which act as a personal teleprompter, is the perfect set of invisible, yet superpowered, training wheels. And the public notes? Well, those are more like demonstrating your all-around awesomeness--cruising around with a double-scoop ice cream cone in one hand, gracefully avoiding potholes and gravel patches, with your sparkly tassels streaming out behind you on a summer evening. No big deal, once you get the hang of it. Also, fun. How can you achieve this freewheeling awesomeness? It's actually a piece of cake, and this 60-second video shows you everything you need to know: https://vimeo.com/67339794?utm_source=Haiku+Deck+Account+Holders&utm_campaign=002d6eedcb-Notes6_19_2013&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_16b8d96520-002d6eedcb-320800917 When you're ready to ride, just open the app and take the notes for a spin.
