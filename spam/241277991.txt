Our unique iPad Backpack holds an iPad in front of the photographer so that she can roam around your photo taking photos of guests on the dance floor, red carpet, and beyond. Photos instantly appear on the iPad so that guests can upload them instantly to Facebook, Twitter, and Email. 3) The Photo Party Station - The Photo Party Station is super sleek alternative to a photo booth. A touchscreen mounted in a slick housing makes for an awesome photo booth experience open to the entire party while only taking up about 1 foot square.  With options to upload to social media as well as instant printing this is a great solution for a tight space. We use your party as the background of the photos. Add a fisheye lens for a funky-MTV look. Please give me a call so that we can discuss the option that works best for you.
