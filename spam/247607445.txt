I always mean to do my duty on board MDIxNTcxMTM4NzI2MTEyMTQ4MjJiNDVmYzkwYzM0YTM_ ship." "I have told you to flog this boy!" "I can't do it, Captain Haley. I have a boy of my own about the size of that lad there, and, if I struck him, I'd think it was my own boy that stood in his place." This unexpected opposition excited the fierce resentment of the captain. He felt that a crisis had come, and he was determined to be obeyed. "Unless you do 3548a446ba5944547b52b45fc90c34a3 as I bid you, I will keep you in irons for the rest of the voyage!" "You are the captain of this ship, and can throw me in irons, if you like," said Bates, with an air of dignity despite his tarred hands and sailor jacket. "I have refused to do no duty that belongs to me. When I signed my name to the ship's papers, I did not agree to flog boys." "Put him in irons!" roared the captain, incensed. "We will see who is captain of this 3548a446ba5944547b52b45fc90c34a3 ship!" The mandate was obeyed, and Bates was lodged in the forecastle, securely ironed. The 1626987180 MDIxNTcxMTM4NzI2MTEyMTQ4MjJiNDVmYzkwYzM0YTM_ captain himself seized the cat, and was about to apply it to the luckless cabin-boy, when a terrible blast, springing up in an instant, as it were, struck the ship, almost throwing it upon its side. There was no time for punishment now. The safety of the ship required instant action, and Frank Price was permitted to replace his jacket without having received a blow. CHAPTER XXIX. THE CAPTAIN'S REVENGE The storm which commenced so suddenly was one of great violence. It required all the captain's seamanship, and the efforts of all the crew, to withstand it. However reluctant to do it, Captain Haley was forced to release Bates from his irons, and order him to duty. The latter worked energetically, and showed that he did not intend to shirk any part of his duties as seaman. But the result of the storm was that the vessel was driven out of her course, and her rigging suffered considerable injury. The wind blew all night. Toward morning it abated, and, as the morning light broke, the lookout described a small island distant about a league.
