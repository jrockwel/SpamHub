Hello You will have to pass through verification process for sending bank wire only. If you want to send us WU - maximum amount per transfer is 5000 USD. For huge amount sometimes we can provide discounts but you need to contact us before. ----- Original message ----- Hi, I was wondering if funding liberty reserve with western union requires any IDs (or verification).
