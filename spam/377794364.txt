Here's my tentative plan, please chime in if you think I could/should be doing something different: -2 Butts from Costco -Plowboy Rub -3 to 4 chunks of cherry Get the UDS up to 275*ish and put the butts on. Foil with some apple juice at 165* and continue to cook until 195 - 200*ish. Throw in cooler until       I get to my listing and then pull . Questions: When I foil, do I just literally wrap it in foil or do I need to put it in an aluminum pan covered with foil? (sorry, dumb question, I know). Is 2 butts enough for 15 to 25 people? What time should I start tomorrow night to be safe? My tour starts at 11:00, but I need to be done no later than 7 or 8 in the morning.

First to answer a couple questions: Yes, it was my first attempt at pulled pork. I did use the boneless shoulder from Costco. I allowed everyone to sauce their own. I rubbed it down with Plowboy in the morning and let it sit until I got home from work on Monday. The UDS was running a bit hot that evening, about 275*. I used a few chunks of hickory. Started at 6:00 and by 10:00 both shoulders were at the 165* mark. Put both in an aluminum pan, poured a mix of 50/50 apple juice/RC cola over the top and foiled. By 1:00AM they were at 205*. Triple wrapped both, wrapped in thick towels and put in my cooler. The tour started at 11:00 and when I went to pull it at 10:45, the temps were still in the neighborhood of 150*. Some comments from the agents: -"Wow!" -"I've never had pulled pork this moist and flavorful!" -"My husband is a BBQ enthusiast, and you did a real fine job with yours." One agent even called me after she left the open and told me that she thought it was so good that I should tell people not to bother saucing their sandwiches. She then asked me if I would make pulled pork for an upcoming office event. So, all-in-all, I'd say it was a pretty awesome trial run! :-) I'm sure that I need to upgrade to a bone-in butt the next time, and my fire control was sure sloppy this time.
