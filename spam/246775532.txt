EVG Update The Next Crash Will Happen On Obama’s Watch! Hi randy, at this time we’d like to offer our condolences to President Obama. http://links.mkt3649.com/ctt?kn=8&ms=NTA4OTU0OAS2&r=ODE5Mzk3NzMxS0&b=2&j=NTgxMTk3MzUS1&mt=1&rt=0 EVG Research Team here, and no, we’re not confused about who won the election. We offer our condolences because we are now nearly 100% certain the next economic crash will happen on Obama’s watch. When the dollar walks off a cliff and the people’s savings are sucked dry with each passing day... When the next wave of job layoffs comes crashing down on an already tired and weary public... When the rise in gas, food and other energy prices can no longer be ignored, skyrocketing to record levels... And when the bad gets terrifyingly worse, President Obama will most likely be in charge. The day after the election, the DOW fell 312 points. Yet at the same time, the stock prices of gun-makers Smith & Wesson and Sturm, Ruger & Co. surged 8% and 6% higher.. That’s because, just like after the 2008 election, people are purchasing more guns and ammo. That’s one way to prepare for the coming crash. Another way is by turning to The Elevation Group. (Over the next 4 years, millions will see their hopes of retirement threatened by economic collapse.

Had Governor Romney been elected, we’d be offering him condolences too. But now that the election is settled, it’s important to analyze where we are and where things are going from here. Will President Obama Do the Right Thing? There’s only one way to make the coming crash easier, and that’s to pay down our debt. The less debt we have, the less interest we will have to pay once rates inevitably rise. But President Obama has no plans to pay down the debt. At most, he hopes to shrink the rate of new debt by a little. It was the same with Governor Romney. But that’s not enough. The US will hit the new debt ceiling of $16.394 trillion early next year. And while some have hope that the debt limit will not be raised, that’s unlikely. Congress and the President will find some way to move the debt ceiling higher - just like they always have - and we will continue to tack on trillions. In Obama’s first 4 years, the debt moved from $9.1 trillion to more than $16.2 trillion. We’re almost certain to pass $20 trillion in his next 4 years - and maybe go much higher. If interest rates surge like they did in the early 1980’s, the last time we faced high inflation, paying 10%-15% on TWENTY TRILLION in debt will consume our annual budget. Just like Bill Clinton warned about at the Democratic National Convention - which no one but us seemed to notice. When that time comes, we’ll either default honestly, by restructuring our debt in a bankruptcy just like corporations and people do. This will lead to mass deflation.. OR... the Federal Reserve, with Obama’s blessing, will start printing money to pay the interest on the debt. This will lead to mass inflation. Either way, through mass deflation or inflation, this will cause an economic collapse like we’ve never seen before. How Obama Will Handle the Crash Will he blame his predecessor? I bet many critics would say “Yes.” But we think, probably not. He’ll blame capitalism. He’ll blame greedy corporations and banks. He’ll blame anything but government policy or government spending - just like President Bush did when he said “Wall Street got drunk.” The danger this time, is, the government will be in desperate need of money. And anyone whose wealth is not destroyed by the crash could be a target. In Obama’s own words, “ I think when you spread the wealth around, it’s good for everybody.” That’s why just buying gold & silver is not a foolproof strategy today. The government has confiscated gold before and it could do it again. Fortunately, we’re prepared. The Elevation Group Has a Plan to Survive and Thrive Under Any President Let’s make it simple. The government tends to grow from one administration to the next, no matter which party is in charge. So at The Elevation Group, we’re not surprised that the man who oversaw more debt than any other President in history got re-elected. And we were certainly prepared for it. Our strategy takes into account government growing larger and larger, because that is what our government has done since day one. It doesn’t affect our plan at all. We have unique gold and silver strategy sessions that deal with the issue of gold confiscation... and also how to avoid the 28% tax most gold-owners are forced to pay if they ever sell. (We bet your gold dealer doesn’t tell you about that tax.) And most importantly, our investment strategy sessions are designed to withstand inflation AND deflation. To discover how to thrive and prosper during the coming crash, that we expect to hit during Obama’s next 4 years, join us at The Elevation Group.

He couldn’t erase the debt if he tried, but he’s not trying. The debt will grow and money will continue to be printed. But we’re prepared to survive and thrive regardless.
