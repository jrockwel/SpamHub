Amazon CloudSearch enables customers to offload the administrative burdens of operating and scaling a search service. Customers don't have to worry about hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, data partitioning, or software patches. Amazon CloudSearch automatically scales as the volume of data and traffic fluctuates. Built for high throughput and low latency, Amazon CloudSearch supports a rich set of features including free text search, faceted search, customizable relevance ranking, configurable search fields, text processing options, and near real-time indexing. To learn more, visit the: http://aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/. *PHP and Git Deployment for AWS Elastic Beanstalk* AWS Elastic Beanstalk now supports a PHP runtime and Git deployment. Elastic Beanstalk already makes it easier to quickly deploy and manage Java applications in the AWS cloud. Now, Elastic Beanstalk offers the same functionality for your PHP applications. You can easily launch a PHP environment using the AWS Management Console or the Elastic Beanstalk command line interface. You can now set up your Git repositories to directly deploy changes to your AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments. Git speeds up deployments by only pushing your modified files to AWS Elastic Beanstalk. In seconds, PHP applications get updated on a set of Amazon EC2 instances. To learn more about how to launch your PHP environment and use Git to deploy, go to http://docs..amazonwebservices.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_PHP.html in the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide. *Amazon RDS Launches Free Trial program* AWS is introducing a limited time free trial program to help new Amazon RDS customers get started. Customers eligible for the free trial will be able to run one free Single-AZ Small DB Instance for sixty (60) days, along with 20 GB of database storage capacity and 10 million IO requests. You can run a MySQL or Oracle database (using the BYOL model) on your free DB Instance.. The free trial is now available in all regions. For more information about the Amazon RDS Free Trial program, please visit http://aws.amazon.com/rds/free-trial/. To learn more about Amazon RDS, visit http://aws.amazon.com/rds/. *Amazon RDS Increases Backup Retention Period* The automated backup feature of Amazon RDS enables point-in-time recovery for your DB Instance, allowing you to restore your DB Instance to any second during your retention period, up to the last five minutes. Many customers have requested for longer backup retention periods for compliance purposes. We are excited to announce that the maximum retention period for automated backups has been increased from eight days to thirty five days. This new limit will enable you to store more than a month of backups. To modify the retention period for your DB instance to a higher limit, please visit http://aws.amazon.com/console/. * Announcing the Availability of Reserved Cache Nodes for Amazon ElastiCache* We are excited to announce the availability of Reserved Cache Nodes for Amazon ElastiCache. This allows you to save up to 70% over On Demand prices while adding a Memcached-compatible, in-memory cache to your application architecture in a matter of minutes. To learn more about how Amazon ElastiCache can speed up your web applications and how to save money using Reserved Cache Nodes please visit the Amazon ElastiCache Detail Page: https://aws.amazon.com/elasticache. *Amazon Route 53 announces Latency Based Routing (LBR) * Amazon Route 53’s new Latency Based Routing (LBR) feature helps improve your application’s performance for a global audience by routing your customers to the AWS endpoint (e.g. EC2 instances, Elastic IPs or ELBs) that provides the fastest experience based on actual performance measurements of the different AWS regions where your application is running. Learn more by registering for our Introduction to Latency Based Routing (LBR) with Amazon Route 53 webinar on April 26th at 10AM PST at https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/546920178/. You can also learn more by reading Jeff Barr's blog post: http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/03/latency-based-multi-region-routing-now-available-for-aws.html. *Amazon CloudFront Launches Two Solutions for Live Streaming and Lowers Minimum Content Expiration Period* We are excited to announce that we have recently launched two solutions for live streaming using Amazon CloudFront. You can now use Amazon CloudFront with Amazon EC2 running Windows Media Services for live Smooth Streaming which enables you to deliver live media over HTTP to both Microsoft Silverlight clients and Apple iOS devices. You can also now use Amazon CloudFront with Adobe Flash Media Server 4.5 running on Amazon EC2 to configure live HTTP streaming to both Flash Player and Apple iOS devices. Learn more on Jeff Barr’s blog post: http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/03/live-streaming-cloudfront-fms-4-5.html or at our webinar with speakers from both Amazon CloudFront and Adobe on May 04, 2012 at 10:00AM PDT: https://www2.gotomeeting.com/register/705268474. We're also pleased to announce that you can now use Amazon CloudFront for frequently changing content. Before today, Amazon CloudFront’s edge locations cached objects for a minimum of 60 minutes. Effective today, we’ve removed the sixty minute minimum expiration period (also known as “time-to-live” or TTL) from Amazon CloudFront. *Amazon CloudFront Annual Survey - Your Feedback Helps Make our Product Better* Please take a moment to help us improve our product by taking the 2012 Amazon CloudFront Survey. We welcome your input on how we’re doing and what we could be doing better. This survey is open to all AWS customers. The survey link is at http://aws.qualtrics.com/SE/?SID=SV_e4eM1cRblPaccFS. *AWS CloudFormation makes it easier for you to create, update, and manage your AWS resources in a predictable way* There is a new feature for AWS CloudFormation that allows you to add or remove resources from your running stack, enabling your stack to evolve as its requirements change over time. With AWS CloudFormation, you can now manage the complete lifecycle the AWS resources powering your application. AWS CloudFormation allows you to create the AWS infrastructure and configure your EC2 instances to run your application. As your application evolves, you can now add AWS resources, change their properties, or even update the software for your application. AWS CloudFormation uses templates to describe the resources and configuration your application needs. Templates are simple JSON formatted text files that can be placed under source control mechanisms, alongside your application source. For more details on managing your AWS resources using AWS CloudFormation, visit http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/04/the-cloudformation-circle-of-life-part-1.html. * Amazon Elastic MapReduce now supports Pig 0.9.2, Hive 0.7.1.4, and Pig Versioning* Pig 0.9.2 adds support for a number of features including user-defined functions written in Python, Boolean data types, and using Amazon S3 paths to register UDFs. You can also now provide a specific Pig version to use at job flow launch or specify that you would like to use our “latest” version, ensuring that you always have access to our most up-to-date features. For more information please visit Configuring Pig in the Amazon EMR Developer Guide: http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/ElasticMapReduce/latest/DeveloperGuide/emr-configure-pig.html. * Customer Q&A: Cloud Innovation at Intuit and Edmodo using Amazon RDS* Recently our CTO Werner Vogels had a great conversation with Troy Otillio from Intuit and Jack Murgia from Edmodo.
