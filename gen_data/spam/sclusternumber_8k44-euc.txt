 Click here to view this email as a web page Insider Report from Newsmax.com Headlines (Scroll down for complete stories): 1. Obama-Backed Battery Plant Furloughing Workers 2. Most in Higher Tax Bracket for 2013 if Bush Cuts Expire 3. Report: Nuclear Iran Means Double Oil Prices 4. Immigrant Population at an All-Time High 5. 1,035,000 Construction Jobs Lost Under Obama 1. Obama-Backed Battery Plant Furloughing Workers Two years after a groundbreaking ceremony attended by President Obama, a Michigan plant built with $150 million in taxpayer funds to make batteries for hybrid vehicles is putting workers on furlough — before a single battery has been produced. Employees at the Compact Power manufacturing plant in Holland, Mich., are working only three weeks a month due to a lack of demand for lithium-ion cells. The plant — run by LG Chem, a South Korean company — was opened in July 2010 to make batteries for the Chevrolet Volt, a plug-in hybrid vehicle built by GM. But the car has seen sluggish sales, despite a $7,500 federal tax credit for each vehicle, and fewer than 25,000 Volts had been sold by September. Production of the car has been plagued by several plant shutdowns. “Considering the lack of demand for electric vehicles, despite billions of dollars from the Obama administration that were supposed to stimulate it, it’s not surprising what has happened with LG Chem,” Paul Chesser, an associate fellow with the National Legal and Policy Center, told Fox News. “Just because a ton of money is poured into a product does not mean that people will buy it.” The $300 million plant was supposed to produce 15,000 batteries per year and create hundreds of new jobs. But so far just 200 workers are employed at the plant, and batteries for the Volts are instead being made by an LG Chem plant in South Korea. The Michigan plant has spent the past two years building infrastructure and conducting pre-production “test runs,” Fox reported. The factory was partly funded by a $150 million grant from the U.S. Energy Department, and received tax breaks from the local government worth nearly $50 million over 15 years in property taxes and $2.5 million a year in business taxes. Obama told workers at the groundbreaking ceremony: “You are leading the way in showing how manufacturing jobs are coming right back here to the United States.” But former congressman and 2012 Senate candidate Pete Hoekstra, whose House district included Holland, said the stimulus plan that provided funds for the plant “was designed to create jobs in the short term. It doesn’t exactly meet the criteria of stimulus for me.” And Kelsey Knight, a spokeswoman for the Mitt Romney presidential campaign in Michigan, said in a statement reported by the Holland Sentinel that “a factory that produces nothing and furloughs workers is a symbol of where American is going under [Obama’s] failed policies.” Footnote: An LG Chem spokesman said workers who are on furloughs one week a month are eligible to collect unemployment benefits for that week.

Most in Higher Tax Bracket for 2013 if Bush Cuts Expire The expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts would have a significant effect on taxpayers at all income levels — including the lowest-earning Americans. The Bureau of Labor Statistics recently released its August 2012 consumer price index figure, typically the final piece of information required to determine next year’s federal income tax brackets, the Tax Foundation explained. “Projecting 2013’s brackets is more complicated than usual given the uncertainty surrounding the potential expiration of the Bush cuts, originally enacted in 2001 and 2003, and more recent stimulus bill tax cuts originally passed in 2009,” the Foundation observes. “But since tax parameters are adjusted for inflation in more or less the same way, the Tax Foundation can project next year’s parameters under a variety of scenarios with a high degree of certainty.” With the Bush cuts in place, lower-income married joint filers pay a rate of 10 percent up to earnings of $17,900. But if the cuts expire, they would be boosted into the 15 percent bracket, which extends all the way to earnings of $60,550. Taxpayers earning from $72,500 to $146,400 currently pay at a rate of 25 percent. Without the Bush cuts, earnings up to $146,400 will be taxed at the rate of 28 percent. The 28 percent bracket currently covers married joint filers earning from $146,400 to $223,050. Without the cuts, their rate will rise to 31 percent. Similarly, the current 33 percent bracket will increase to 36 percent without the Bush cuts, and the top bracket, 35 percent, will rise to 39.6 percent for those earning $398,350 or more. Single filers and head of household filers will see comparable tax increases if the Bush-era cuts are allowed to expire next year. Under President Obama’s 2013 budget, the cuts would expire only for those earning $247,000 or more. Expiration of the cuts would also affect the standard deduction for married filers and the Earned Income Tax Credit, among other factors. Editor's Note: ALERT: 4 Early Signs You'll Get Parkinson's 3. Report: Nuclear Iran Means Double Oil Prices Oil prices could nearly double, costing the United States millions of jobs, if Iran is permitted to obtain a nuclear weapon — even if the Iranians don’t use the weapon, a new report warns. The Bipartisan Policy Center’s report says that gasoline prices could increase by more than 70 percent, by up to $2.75 per gallon, sending inflation skyrocketing, driving America “into a severe recession,” and costing the country “more than five million jobs.” The report was written by a team of former military leaders, economists, and lawmakers. It states: “Our analysis suggests that a nuclear Iran would heighten expectation of potential future disruptions, which should translate, if understood properly, into an increased risk premium added onto oil prices for as long as the concerns and tensions remain. “In other words, anticipation of future energy oil disruption would be priced into the market, leading to higher oil and gasoline prices.” The report’s authors “think that the expectation alone of instability and conflict that a nuclear Iran could trigger” could increase the price of oil, said Michael Makovsky, director of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Foreign Policy Project, speaking to reporters on Wednesday during a discussion about the report. Former Democratic Sen. Charles Robb told the audience that while much attention has been given to the costs of preventive military action against Iran, “inaction also poses economic risks. Heightened expectation and instability triggered by the consequences of a nuclear Iran would cause the price of oil to go much higher and remain high, significantly impacting the U.S. economy.” In the short term, oil prices could rise by $11 to $27 a barrel after Iran announces it has a working nuclear bomb, according to the report. And prices could soar by up to $55 a barrel in the following three years. A nuclear-armed Iran could easily disrupt the flow of oil by closing the Strait of Hormuz, cutting off the supply of Saudi Arabian oil — and leading the Saudis to seek nuclear weapons as well, according to the Center’s analysis, which was reported by the Washington Free Beacon. The Center’s report adds: “If any of the conflicts or energy disruptions that become more likely from a nuclear Iran actually occur, the energy impact and economic consequences would be more severe.” And Dennis Ross, a former Middle East adviser to President Obama, warns: “It’s hard to imagine Iran with nuclear weapons behaving more responsibly than they are today.” Editor's Note: The IRS' Worst Nightmare — How to Pay Zero Income Taxes 4. Immigrant Population at an All-Time High The number of immigrants both legal and illegal in the United States hit a new record of 40 million in 2010, a 28 percent increase from 2000, a wide-ranging new report reveals. And the number of immigrants plus their children born in this country now stands at around 50 million, accounting for about one-sixth of the U.S. population, according to Steven A. Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies. His report — "Immigrants in the United States, 2010: A Profile of America’s Foreign-Born Population" — is based on U.S. Census Bureau data from 2010 and 2011. “One of the most important findings is that immigration has dramatically increased the size of the nation’s low-income population,” Camarota writes, adding that even immigrants who have been in the country for 20 years are much more likely to live in poverty, lack health insurance, and take advantage of welfare benefits than are native-born Americans. The all-time high of 40 million immigrants is up sharply from 9.6 million in 1970, although the immigrant share of the population, 12.9 percent, is lower than it was in 1910 — 14.7 percent. New immigration both legal and illegal plus births to immigrants added 22.5 million residents over the last decade, accounting for 80 percent of the total U.S. population growth. The Center estimates that 28 percent of immigrants are in the country illegally. Camarota also points out that between 12 million and 15 million new immigrants, legal and illegal, are expected to settle in the United States in the next 20 years. Other findings of the Center’s study include: In March 2011, 68 percent of immigrants aged 18 to 65 held a job, the same as for natives. In 2010, 23 percent of immigrants and their U.S.-born children under age 18 lived in poverty, compared to 13.5 percent of natives and their children. Among countries accounting for the most immigrants in the United States, poverty is highest for those from Mexico (35 percent), Honduras (34 percent), and Guatemala (31 percent), and lowest for Germany (7 percent) and India (6 percent). 36 percent of immigrant-headed households used at least one major welfare program in 2010, primarily food assistance and Medicaid, compared to 23 percent of native households. 29 percent of immigrants and their American-born children lacked health insurance that year, compared to 13.8 percent for natives. 10.4 million students from immigrant households are in public schools, and 78 percent of them speak a language other than English at home. Self-employment is highest among immigrants from Korea and Canada and lowest among those from Haiti and Honduras. Of adult immigrants aged 25 to 65, 28 percent have not completed high school, compared to 7 percent of natives. Immigrants account for 27.2 percent of the population in California, 22.2 percent in New York, and 21 percent in New Jersey, but just 1.2 percent in West Virginia. The state showing the largest increase in immigrant population from 2000 to 2010 was Alabama, up 92.1 percent, followed by South Carolina (88.4 percent), and Tennessee (81.8 percent). New York was lowest (11.1 percent). Remarkably, the immigrant population in North Carolina rose a whopping 524 percent from 1990 to 2010. Of those immigrants in the United States in 2010, the greatest number came from Mexico, 11.7 million, followed by China/Hong Kong/Taiwan (2.1 million), India (1.78 million), Philippines (1.77 million), and Vietnam (1.2 million). Another interesting fact the report has brought to light: While many Americans believe immigrants dominate in a number of professions, the fact is that natives account for 52 percent of maids, 73 percent of janitors, and 66 percent of construction laborers. The only category where immigrants form a majority is “Farm Workers Non-Supervisors,” at 53.5 percent. Editor's Note: 3 Secrets to Never Getting Sick Again 5. 1,035,000 Construction Jobs Lost Under Obama President Barack Obama vowed in February 2009 that the economic stimulus legislation he was signing would create construction jobs for 400,000 people building and rebuilding the nation's infrastructure. But despite a price tag now estimated at $833 billion, there are 925,000 fewer construction jobs in the United States than in February 2009, and 1,035,000 fewer than when Obama was inaugurated, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). And there are even 484,000 fewer jobs than when the last recession officially ended in June 2009. When Obama signed the stimulus bill in Denver, Colo., he told a crowd: "Because we know we can't build our economic future on the transportation and information networks of the past, we are remaking the American landscape with the largest new investment in our nation's infrastructure since Eisenhower built an Interstate Highway System in the 1950s. "Because of this investment, nearly 400,000 men and women will go to work rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, repairing our faulty dams and levees, bringing critical broadband connections to businesses and homes in nearly every community in America, upgrading mass transit, building high-speed rail lines that will improve travel and commerce throughout our nation." But in September 2012, according to the BLS, 5,523,000 Americans had jobs in the construction industry, down from 6,558,000 in January 2009, when Obama took office, and down from 6,448,000 in February 2009, when Obama signed the stimulus. It is also down from 5,564,000 in January of this year, when Obama started the fourth year of his term. Construction jobs in the United States peaked at 7,726,000 in April 2006.

It will be the 16th of his presidency and the first since his reelection last week. CNN's daily Gut Check asked those that cover Washington for what they'll be watching for. Here are five things: 1. Does Obama see a mandate? Post-election news conferences always have an air of history to them as they set the initial tone for the next two to four years of an administration. Who could forget Obama's dubbing 2010 a "shellacking" after Democrats were crushed in the midterms, or the newly re-elected George W. Bush on Nov. 4, 2004, smirking at cameras as he declared, "I pledged to reach out to the whole nation. And today, I'm proving that I'm willing to reach out to everybody by including the White House press corps." Will Obama himself claim a mandate as he pushes Congress to deal? And if he does, will he say, "The American people are with me on this," or will he be specific as to his interpretation of why he feels he earned the majority of America's votes? Many issues same since Obama's last news conference 2. Standing by his man With the scandal involving former CIA Director David Petraeus heating up just as the Afghanistan war enters a crucial phase, CNN's chief political analyst Gloria Borger tells Gut Check, "The president's vote of confidence in Gen. (John) Allen" will have her eye tomorrow. Will Obama stand by his top commander unequivocally? The Petraeus scandal: What we know Obama meets labor leaders Obama 'surprised' by Petraeus scandal Norquist: Tax cuts should be extended 3. New second-term relationships Senior Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash asks, "Will the president do in his second term what Republicans as well as Democrats on Capitol Hill complain he didn't do in his first -- reach out? "He told Jessica Yellin in her documentary that he doesn't have time to socialize because he has two young daughters. But he's got to eat lunch, right? Have coffee in the morning? Will he vow to make more of an effort to get to know lawmakers in his second term? By all accounts -- especially from Democratic lawmakers -- not doing that hurt him in his first term. Maybe he'll make more time over the next four years." Obama demands fast action on fiscal cliff 4. Taking the lead on immigration CNN's White House Producer Lesa Jansen writes, "I want to hear from the president on his strategy for passing bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform. "After winning back the White House with an astounding 71% of the Latino vote, can the president lay out a plan to tackle the immigration issue? Republicans are apparently ready to sign on but House Speaker John Boehner recently said it is the president who must lead. Appearing on the Spanish-language television network Univision before the election, Obama said the 'greatest failure' of his presidency was not being able to pass immigration reform. Will this issue help to shape the Obama legacy?" Five reasons why time may be right for immigration reform 5. National insecurity CNN's Security Clearance Blog Editor Adam Levine tells us, "I want to hear how convincing the president is about his foreign policy and national security being on terra firma given the abrupt departure of Petraeus, the investigation of the top commander in Afghanistan who is in the middle of planning the U.S. endgame in the war and the expected departure of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. "While second-term departures of top officials are expected, the abrupt developments of this past week impact people at the helm of some of the sensitive foreign policy issues facing the nation. It also comes as his administration is marching up to the Hill to brief Congress on what happened in Libya. The scandals will pass but can Obama convince the nation his White House is not embroiled and distracted?" Analysis: Will national security scandal create national security risk?

This might be as a result of improper storage, and hence the vet flea products may be dangerous when used on the dogs. The vet flea drugs may also be too strong and may have a bad effect when used on the smaller dogs. It is always advisable to avoid vet flea products for dogs this summer, which are sold by unlicensed agro vets online, since they may contain the wrong types of vet flea products which can turn out to be counterfeit. These agro vets do not only sell bad quality vets, but on the other hand can be a source of the dogs poor health, and due to these purchases from these types of agro vets should be avoided. While buying vet flea products for dogs this summer, it is always advisable to take caution on the agro vets online, since one can be bound to lies from the various websites. It is also advisable to have a view of all the websites before settling on the one to buy the agro vets from.

Walter Scott, obliged as he was to conform to the ideas of an essentially hypocritical nation, was false to humanity in his picture of woman, because his models were schismatics. The Protestant woman has no ideal. She may be chaste, pure, virtuous; but her unexpansive love will always be as calm and methodical as the fulfilment of a duty. It might seem as though the Virgin Mary had chilled the hearts of those sophists who have banished her from heaven with her treasures of loving kindness. In Protestantism there is no possible future for the woman who has sinned; while, in the Catholic Church, the hope of forgiveness makes her sublime. Hence, for the Protestant writer there is but one Woman, while the Catholic writer finds a new woman in each new situation. If Walter Scott had been a Catholic, if he had set himself the task of describing truly the various phases of society which have successively existed in Scotland, perhaps the painter of Effie and Alice--the two figures for which he blamed himself in his later years--might have admitted passion with its sins and punishments, and the virtues revealed by repentance. Passion is the sum-total of humanity. Without passion, religion, history, romance, art, would all be useless. Some persons, seeing me collect such a mass of facts and paint them as they are, with passion for their motive power, have supposed, but wrongly, that I must belong to the school of Sensualism and Materialism--two aspects of the same thing--Pantheism. But their misapprehension was perhaps justified--or inevitable. I do not share the belief in indefinite progress for society as a whole; I believe in man's improvement in himself. Those who insist on reading in me the intention to consider man as a finished creation are strangely mistaken. _Seraphita_, the doctrine in action of the Christian Buddha, seems to me an ample answer to this rather heedless accusation.

Cultivation of coffee beans originated around 1100 AD in the area of Arabia on the Red Sea. At that time, roasting was not yet practiced so un-roasted coffee beans were brewed to create a beverage similar to tea. Many studies have examined the health effects of coffee, and whether the overall effects of coffee consumption are positive or negative has been widely disputed.[9] The method of brewing coffee has been found to be important in relation to its effects on health. For instance, preparing coffee in a French press leaves more oils in the drink compared with coffee prepared with a paper coffee filter.

 Having trouble viewing this message? view it in your browser.   I mostly over-cooked foods to be sure it was safe to eat. That's good as far as food safety, but the quality was not at its best. I highly recommend the purchase and use of a good food thermometer. Not only will you know your food is smoked/cooked/grilled to at least a safe minimum temperature, but the quality of the finished product will be much better. Owning and using an inaccurate food thermometer could be dangerous, so make sure it reads accurately by performing an ice-water and/or boiling-water test. USDA's Basics for Handling Food Safely: Safe steps in food handling, cooking, and storage are essential to prevent foodborne illness. You can't see, smell, or taste harmful bacteria that may cause illness. In every step of food preparation, follow the four Fight BAC! guidelines to keep food safe: Clean Wash hands and surfaces often. Separate Don't cross-contaminate. Cook Cook to proper temperatures. Chill Refrigerate promptly. Shopping Purchase refrigerated or frozen items after selecting your non-perishables. Never choose meat or poultry in packaging that is torn or leaking. Do not buy food past "Sell-By," "Use-By," or other expiration dates. Storage Always refrigerate perishable food within 2 hours (1 hour when the temperature is above 90 F). Check the temperature of your refrigerator and freezer with an appliance thermometer. The refrigerator should be at 40 F or below and the freezer at 0 F or below. Cook or freeze fresh poultry, fish, ground meats, and variety meats within 2 days; other beef, veal, lamb, or pork, within 3 to 5 days. Perishable food such as meat and poultry should be wrapped securely to maintain quality and to prevent meat juices from getting onto other food. To maintain quality when freezing meat and poultry in its original package, wrap the package again with foil or plastic wrap that is recommended for the freezer. In general, high-acid canned food such as tomatoes, grapefruit, and pineapple can be stored on the shelf for 12 to 18 months. Low-acid canned food such as meat, poultry, fish, and most vegetables will keep 2 to 5 years if the can remains in good condition and has been stored in a cool, clean, and dry place. Discard cans that are dented, leaking, bulging, or rusted. Preparation Always wash hands with warm water and soap for 20 seconds before and after handling food. Don't cross-contaminate. Keep raw meat, poultry, fish, and their juices away from other food. After cutting raw meats, wash cutting board, utensils, and countertops with hot, soapy water. Cutting boards, utensils, and countertops can be sanitized by using a solution of 1 tablespoon of unscented, liquid chlorine bleach in 1 gallon of water. Marinate meat and poultry in a covered dish in the refrigerator. Thawing Refrigerator: The refrigerator allows slow, safe thawing. Make sure thawing meat and poultry juices do not drip onto other food. Cold Water: For faster thawing, place food in a leak-proof plastic bag. Submerge in cold tap water. Change the water every 30 minutes. Cook immediately after thawing. Microwave: Cook meat and poultry immediately after microwave thawing. Cooking Cook all raw beef, pork, lamb and veal steaks, chops, and roasts to a minimum internal temperature of 145 F as measured with a food thermometer before removing meat from the heat source. For safety and quality, allow meat to rest for at least three minutes before carving or consuming. For reasons of personal preference, consumers may choose to cook meat to higher temperatures. Ground meats: Cook all raw ground beef, pork, lamb, and veal to an internal temperature of 160 F as measured with a food thermometer. Poultry: Cook all poultry to an internal temperature of 165 F as measured with a food thermometer. Serving Hot food should be held at 140 F or warmer. Cold food should be held at 40 F or colder. When serving food at a buffet, keep food hot with chafing dishes, slow cookers, and warming trays. Keep food cold by nesting dishes in bowls of ice or use small serving trays and replace them often. Perishable food should not be left out more than 2 hours at room temperature (1 hour when the temperature is above 90 F). Leftovers Discard any food left out at room temperature for more than 2 hours (1 hour if the temperature was above 90 F). Place food into shallow containers and immediately put in the refrigerator or freezer for rapid cooling. Use cooked leftovers within 4 days. Reheat leftovers to 165 F. Refreezing Meat and poultry defrosted in the refrigerator may be refrozen before or after cooking. If thawed by other methods, cook before refreezing.

Tony was probably getting a hit blessing or attending a high ranking mafia meeting. PS Rapaport at 7:44 AM June 20, 2013 Here in England James Gandolfini is now acknowledged as one of the greatest character actors of all-times - in the same league as Laurence Oliivier, Daniel Day Lewis and (in their early careers) Brando, Nicholson, De Niro and Pacino. He was mesmerising, brave, intuitive and totally addictive to watch. An enormous loss to Hollywood, HBO and the acting profession as well as his family and friends. By LAUREN MORASKI / CBS NEWS/ June 20, 2013, 9:50 AM James Gandolfini had many roles ahead of him James Gandolfini takes a bow at curtain call during the Broadway opening of "God Of Carnage" at Bernard Jacobs Theatre on March 22, 2009, in New York. / JEMAL COUNTESS/GETTY IMAGES 1 Comment / Shares/ Tweets/Stumble/EmailMore + Although the screen went dark in "The Sopranos" finale -- marking the last time we saw James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano in 2007 -- since then, Gandolfini, who died Wednesday at age 51, had kept quite the busy schedule in Hollywood. And this won't be the last we see of him on screen. In the years following his time on HBO's "The Sopranos" Gandolfini made plenty of TV and film appearances. In 2009, he provided the voice of the character Carol in the film "Where the Wild Things Are." Two years later, he was seen in the thriller "Down the Shore," with Famke Janssen, as well as in the TV movie "Cinema Verite" with Diane Lane and Tim Robbins. 32 PHOTOS James Gandolfini: 1961-2013 News of Taylor-Johnson's appointment came from the British author who became the publishing sensation of 2012 when her trilogy sold more than 70 mil copies. "I'm delighted & thrilled to let you guys know that Sam Taylor-Johnson has agreed to direct the film of Fifty Shades of Grey," tweeted James. Taylor-Johnson, 46, made her name as a visual artist, nominated for the prestigious Turner prize in 1998 and whose works include a video portrait of a sleeping David Beckham that is on show in London's National Portrait Gallery. She came to prominence in the film world with her 2009 feature debut "Nowhere Boy", the story of John Lennon's childhood in Liverpool before he joined the Beatles. She garnered two BAFTA nominations for the film and last year Taylor-Johnson, formerly known as Sam Taylor-Wood, married the 23-year-old star of the film, star Aaron Johnson. Taylor-Johnson said she was excited to be charged with the evolution of "Fifty Shades of Grey" from page to screen. "For the legions of fans, I want to say that I will honor the power of Erika's book and the characters of Christian and Anastasia. They are under my skin too," she said in a statement. The trilogy follows the sadomasochistic relationship of a 27-year-old, Christian Grey, and college student Anastasia Steele, gaining attention for its graphic sex scenes. Universal Pictures, a unit of Comcast Corp, paid to secure the film rights for the trilogy in March last year. No actors have yet been announced for the film although a host of names have been suggested for the lead roles.

That success led to an explosion in original series for basic cable networks, a trend that continues with such Soprano-like antiheroes as tortured cop Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis) on FX's "The Shield"; the ad man with the double life, Don Draper (Jon Hamm) on AMC's "Mad Men"; and vigilante serial killer Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall) on Showtime's "Dexter." "The Sopranos" started a movement toward edgier programming on cable that ultimately led to sharp viewing declines for the major networks. Gandolfini was born in Westwood, N.J., on Sept. 18, 1961, to working-class parents of Italian American stock. His father was a bricklayer who later became a high school custodian; his mother worked in a cafeteria at the same school. His immigrant parents spoke Italian at home, but Gandolfini, one of three children, never learned the language although, he later told interviewers, he always understood when they were angry with him. He retained a strong sense of his Italian roots into adulthood, he later said. PHOTOS: Celebrities react on Twitter As the first-born male child of ambitious immigrants, he faced intense parental pressure to attend college, a notion he initially resisted. He earned a bachelor's degree in communications in 1983 from Rutgers University. "My mother beat it into me, 'You're going, you're going,' " he later recalled. He finally relented and on his first night at Rutgers strolled into a keg party. "I thought, 'What was I fighting for?' " he later joked.

Speedy-Snail-Database-Administration--11383 Caberfae Ave--Allendale, Michigan--49401-9143 Here's some places you gotta check out and eat sometime in your life. Ruxbin, Chicago It's BYOB, because thanks to some municipal technicality, this place will never have a liquor license. And while chefs like Grant Achatz (See: Next) get blank checks to open their new restaurants, the Kims (brother, sister, girlfriend) had just enough money for this old, busted-up Italian-beef stand in Chicago's Ukrainian Village. They had no design funds, so they hired an artist who created a space of found partsvintage theater seats and church pews. They have no room for a walk-in cooler, so chef Edward Kim, who was recently at Per Se in New York, takes daily deliveries himself. But when you walk into the restaurant, when the first of many smiling faces says something like "Enjoy your evening," you sense exactly none of this hardship. The thirty-two-seat room feels as if it's been carefully assembled over a lifetime. The menus are hand-embossed each day. And the food, like the rest of the place, is labored over. Time and energy take the place of overused, overpriced ingredients. Squid stuffed with sausage gets depth and heat from a Chile paste imported from a farm in Tennessee. Cream of Wheat, enriched and amplified by lamb drippings and brown butter, is maybe the best thing I ate all year. But when a dish reaches near perfectionlike the wildly popular chicken and wafflesit's cut from the menu and brought back on special occasions so the kitchen can defy the odds from scratch Mica, Philadelphia Mica is lodged in a small stone building along a cobblestone street of gingerbread houses and trolley tracks in Philly's Chestnut Hill neighborhood. It's a scene from a heartwarming children's storybook. AND THE CHEF RECOMMENDS... "The Farm and Fisherman in Philly. The chef was the chef de cuisine at Blue Hill at Stone Barns in New York, and he just nails it. Chip Roman Walk inside and the fairy tale ends. The fireplace is cold, and a draft crawls down the flue and up your legs. Wear long undies if you go on a chilly night. The tables are almost bare. The wine list isn't much. Back in the kitchen is Chip Roman, the chef. He does not come out to chat. He's creating complex dishes and doing it astoundingly well. Mica is about food. The menu has eight appetizers and four mains. There are prix fixe menus, mandatory on weekends, and tasting menus nightly. When I asked if I might add a tasting menu item to my order, I was told no. Mica believes in tough love. And good cooking. We had Barnegat scallops with white chocolate sprinkled on top, enough to add a smidgen of sweetness, exquisitely done. We had Lancaster County chicken, rolled, fried, and stood upright. So much work. With it was bacon, pearl onions, fingerling potatoes, slashes of sour-cherry puree. Shows Roman's training, a stint at Le Bec-Fin. We had foie gras terrine, short ribs with celery-root puree, rockfish with sweet potatoes, black bass in brown butter. All came to the table lavished with accoutrements appropriate to the dish. Nothing showed up twice. Not a sauce. Not a drizzle. Roman reminded me of the young Parisian chefs cooking in stark surroundings, thinking about nothing but their stoves. Maybe he's better than they are, considering the lusciousness of his Manjari-chocolate dessert. Did I mention that he's Mica's pastry chef, too. The Woodsman Tavern, Portland What's astonishing about the Woodsman is not so much that the kitchen doesn't missit's that this place didn't exist until October of last year. It's the restaurant that, if you've never been to Portland, you imagine on every corner: reclaimed wood basking in the glow of Edison bulbs, kitschy Zig-Zag dispensers behind the bar, serious cocktails, serious coffee. But this isn't just some dutiful, farmy Portlandia-esque ideal, and after a few courses, you realize that the "Tavern" descriptor is typical northwestern understatement, like saying that it sometimes rains here. Start with American ham sliced to transparency and served with bread, butter, and pickled collard greens, which make for the best sandwich in a city with a cultish sandwich culture. Chef Jason Barwikowski steals smartly and shamelessly from around the globe, whether it's the perfect acqua pazza on the roasted trout or the smoky hint of Lapsang souchong in their signature riff on a Manhattan. The $4 Josper Tea Sandwich is crustless white bread stuffed with housemade coppa di testa, spicy mustard, and crisp arugulaan English delivery system for Italian charcuterie, seared in the white-hot Josper oven, which is how the kitchen leaves its mark. All that for about the same price as a cup of Portland coffee

Try it now. ‘Disturbing Development’ Grant Fritchey & the DBA Team present the latest installment of the Top 5 hard-earned lessons of a DBA – read it now. Editorial - Great DBAs do <blank> Over on the "developer side" of the Internet, I regularly encounter articles of the type "Great Programmers < do blank> ", where the blanks range from "use source control", to "write reusable/debuggable/self-documenting code", to "work on open source projects in their spare time". There are several potential problems with such articles. At their worst, they appear arrogant, a self-proclamation of greatness on behalf of the writer (" I am great, and I do this… "). Occasionally, they read like a strange form of blackmail (" If you don't learn this you are a bad programmer "). Perhaps most problematically, such statements are usually an over-simplification. Not all great programmers try to write reusable code . Not all great programmers always use source control (Linus Torvalds wrote Linux without source control, apparently, though maybe he's an exceptional case). In general, these blogs do little to clarify what skills and training are essential to make a good developer. By contrast, "Great DBAs < do blank> " articles are largely absent. Why is this? Perhaps it is, at least in part, because Brad McGehee cleared the air with his book How to be an Exceptional DBA . In it, he spells out the skills and qualities that make a good DBA and it is difficult to argue with his detailed prescription. What I like about the book is that it gives a clear message that anyone can become a good DBA, armed with a good ability to absorb knowledge, sound judgment, tact, and the ability to assess critically a given situation and make sensible decisions on how to act. Of course, some of these skills come only with experience, but they do not require a special talent, or an extra lobe to the brain, just application. Brad, of course, is a classic Production DBA rather than a database developer or BI Specialist. He spoke for the traditional DBA role. By contrast, we're still straining to find the consensus understanding of what makes a good data scientist. Shouldn't DBAs, as a profession, take an active role in defining the optimum skills and habits of these emerging specialties before the HR people, journalists and recruiters do it for them? Maybe it will just mean we're afflicted with endless "Great BI specialists | database developers | data scientists < do blank> " blogs! Cheers, Tony.

Some of that plasma splashed back down onto the Sun's surface, sparking bright flashes of ultraviolet light. This dramatic event may provide new insights into how young stars grow by sucking up nearby gas. Share This: The eruption and subsequent splashdown were observed in spectacular detail by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory. This spacecraft watches the Sun 24 hours a day, providing images with better-than-HD resolution. Its Atmospheric Imaging Assembly instrument was designed and developed by researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). "We're getting beautiful observations of the Sun. And we get such high spatial resolution and high cadence that we can see things that weren't obvious before," says CfA astronomer Paola Testa. Movies of the June 7th eruption show dark filaments of gas blasting outward from the Sun's lower right. Although the solar plasma appears dark against the Sun's bright surface, it actually glows at a temperature of about 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit. When the blobs of plasma hit the Sun's surface again, they heat up by a factor of 100 to a temperature of almost 2 million degrees F. As a result, those spots brighten in the ultraviolet by a factor of 2 -- 5 over just a few minutes. The tremendous energy release occurs because the in falling blobs are traveling at high speeds, up to 900,000 miles per hour (400 km/sec). Those speeds are similar to the speeds reached by material falling onto young stars as they grow via accretion. Therefore, observations of this solar eruption provide an "up close" view of what happens on distant stars. "We often study young stars to learn about our Sun when it was an 'infant.' Now we're doing the reverse and studying our Sun to better understand distant stars," notes Testa. These new observations, combined with computer modeling, have helped resolve a decade-long argument over how to measure the accretion rates of growing stars. Astronomers calculate how fast a young star is gathering material by observing its brightness at various wavelengths of light, and how that brightness changes over time. However, they got higher estimates from optical and ultraviolet light than from X-rays. The team discovered that the ultraviolet flashes they observed came from the in falling material itself, not the surrounding solar atmosphere. If the same is true for distant, young stars, then by analyzing the ultraviolet light they emit, we can learn about the material they are accreting. "By seeing the dark spots on the Sun, we can learn about how young stars accrete material and grow." explains Testa.

Pplt is essential for determining Crs and Rtot as follows.Crs Tidal volume Pplt Positive and expiratory pressure Paw Pplt Inhaled flow rateRtot Traditionally, Pplt is measured intermittently due to the need to temporarily modify ventilator settings, and to apply an end inspiratory pause EIP using volumecontrolled ventilation.

This assumes the patient is relaxed and complies with the EIP maneuver, as are those who are appropriately sedated and.or paralyzed, not breathing spontaneously, and receiving volumecontrolledcontinuous mandatory ventilation VCCMV Figure . However, many patients receiving ventilatory support are not paralyzed, but are breathing spontaneously. For example, spontaneously breathing patients may receive pressure support ventilation PSV and.or volumecontrolled synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation VCSIMV. Temporarily applying an EIP maneuver during PSV may be problematic it interferes with the patients breathing, predisposing to patient and ventilator breathing asynchrony, that is, the patient attempts to spontaneously inhale and exhale during the pause, causing erroneous measurements of Pplt Figure . In our experience this occurs approximately of the time when an EIP is applied. Thus, accurate measurements of Pplt, and therefore determinations of Crs and Rtot, may at times be difficult to obtain. An automatic and continuous method of determining Pplt, Crs and Rtot, that is not dependent on an EIP is desirable.

************************************************* ZIM Newsletter ** Tactics that Work in Good and Bad Markets ** ************************************************* Is It The Time To Sell? by Mitch Zacks, Senior Portfolio Manager The selling in the stock market this week is being driven by comments coming from the Federal Reserve. As of June 5th, roughly 27% of the 54 economists surveyed by Bloomberg felt that the Federal Reserve would taper its bond buying in September of this year. After Bernanke��s comments on June 19th, the percentage of economists expecting some sort of pullback in bond purchases by the Federal Reserve rose to 44%. As this data clearly shows, market expectations of when the Fed��s bond buying will begin to be pulled back changed. Basically, Bernanke��s comments signaled to the market that he will taper sooner rather than later. The ten year treasury yield began to rise dramatically on Bernanke��s comments. Currently the yield is around 2.41%. As of the end of last week, the ten-year treasury yield was 2.14%. If we go back further to the end of the first quarter of 2013, the treasury yield was 1.87%. Rates were heading up due to the economic recovery, but the 37 basis point rise since last week can be attributed primarily to the Fed��s comments. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Should You Be Buying Gold Today? Gold prices recently tumbled to a 2��-year low. Is now the time to buy the shiny metal? Will it help protect your portfolio in these uncertain times? Download our special report to answer these questions and more. Click Here To Download your report today. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Federal Reserve��s statement, in addition to causing interest rates to go up, caused bond prices to fall, the dollar to strengthen, stocks to sell-off, gold to crater and international equities to plummet. If anyone doubts the power of the Federal Reserve, you only have to look at the market activity this week �� all of this occurred based on subtle changes in the Federal Reserve��s statements. No action was taken, the Federal Reserve did not change the size of its bond buying, it did not change the stock of bonds they hold and no change was made to interest rates. So what is an investor to do? Well, in the words of Macbeth, economic forecasting is ��a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more: it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.�� The point being that for all the chaos in the market��s reaction to the Federal Reserve, the real issue boils down to whether the economic recovery continues. My best guess is the economic recovery is on track. If you analyze how interest rates move over time, you find there is some degree of serial correlation with regard to changes in interest rates. In other words, when rates are rising, there is a better chance that rates will continue to rise as opposed to fall or stay flat. As a result, I would anticipate that the ten-year rate will continue to rise. Unless we see a recession start to materialize, which I do not expect, there is little chance that bonds will perform very well over the next twelve months. In my mind, the bull market in fixed income securities has ended but the advance of equities is still on track. Rising interest rates are by no means positive for the stock market. The fact that quantitative easing, or bond buying by the Fed, is likely to end earlier than the market anticipated is in no way a good thing for the market in the short-run. However, if rates are rising and the bond buying is ending because the economy is growing, the market can continue to appreciate. A growing economy means increased earnings, which will tend to counterbalance the effect of rising interest rates. The absolute best-case scenario for the market is an economic expansion, accompanied by a falling interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve told us this past week the falling rate environment is over. If you did not own stocks over the past five years you missed the greatest opportunity to generate gains. We are now entering an era in which the economy is likely to expand, but rates are likely to rise. The market should perform decent in such an environment, but not as well as it has since the 2008 financial crisis. Double digit gains of the market are likely behind us, and we are moving in to an era when the market will appreciate, but at an annualized rate in the single digits. My best guess is that the S&P 500 will generate annualized gains, including dividend payments, over the next five years around 6% above what 3-month treasuries are yielding. The Federal Reserve appears to believe the economy will surprise to the upside, as the Fed is more bullish than consensus estimates with regard to GDP expansion. Right now the Federal Reserve is forecasting year-over-year GDP growth of 2.45% in 2013 and 3.25% in 2014. The consensus estimate of GDP growth, from economists surveyed from Bloomberg, is for 1.9% GDP growth this year and for 2.7% GDP growth next year. Personally, I see GDP growth coming in closer to the Fed��s estimates than the street estimates. As a result, I do not think that the bull market in stocks has ended. The worst case scenario, as I explained last week, is for the quantitative easing to be pulled back when a naturally occurring recession is beginning to develop. This would occur if the quantitative easing were allowed to proceed for too long, and was pulled back when the economy was near peaking. By pulling the bond buying back earlier, it causes pain in the short term, but in the long-term is better for the economy. If the Federal Reserve is correct and the economic expansion actually materializes stronger than what Wall-Street expects, the sell-off in the market presents a buying opportunity. For a long-term investor - someone who has a time horizon greater than four years �� I would recommend buying the dips. While continued weakness in the market should be expected, most likely the economic expansion is on track and inflation remains under control. Although the increase in the ten-year yield makes the market less compelling on a valuation basis, when compared to fixed-income securities, my belief is that the bull market is by no means over and stocks remain far more attractive than bonds. I am far more worried by the opaqueness of China and the disruptions occurring in their financial system than I am by a well-functioning and independent Federal Reserve. So where does this leave us for the next four weeks? I go back to the base rate. This market has a 66% chance of rising and a 34% chance of falling over the next four weeks. If you are able to stay invested over the next several years, you will be rewarded for you steadfastness and patience. At the end of the day, you can��t make money without being willing to lose money. Ignore the sound and fury and stay invested for the long haul. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Learn How Mitch Zacks is Investing his Private Clients Today Mitch Zacks, Senior Portfolio Manager at Zacks Investment Management, oversees the management of billions of dollars for private clients.

The Japanese Shogun's secretary boasted (not completely accurately) to a Spanish visitor in 1609 that Japanese clothing had not changed in over a thousand years.[4] However in Ming China, for example, there is considerable evidence for rapidly changing fashions in Chinese clothing.[5] Changes in costume often took place at times of economic or social change (such as in ancient Rome and the medieval Caliphate), but then a long period without major changes followed. This occurred in Moorish Spain from the 8th century, when the famous musician Ziryab introduced sophisticated clothing-styles based on seasonal and daily fashion from his native Baghdad and his own inspiration to C��rdoba in Al-Andalus.[6][7] Similar changes in fashion occurred in the Middle East from the 11th century, following the arrival of the Turks, who introduced clothing styles from Central Asia and the Far East.[8] The beginnings of the habit in Europe of continual and increasingly rapid change in clothing styles can be fairly reliably dated to the middle of the 14th century, to which historians including James Laver and Fernand Braudel date the start of Western fashion in clothing.[9][10] The most dramatic manifestation was a sudden drastic shortening and tightening of the male over-garment, from calf-length to barely covering the buttocks, sometimes accompanied with stuffing on the chest to look bigger. This created the distinctive Western male outline of a tailored top worn over leggings or trousers. The pace of change accelerated considerably in the following century, and women and men's fashion, especially in the dressing and adorning of the hair, became equally complex and changing. Art historians are therefore able to use fashion in dating images with increasing confidence and precision, often within five years in the case of 15th century images. Initially changes in fashion led to a fragmentation of what had previously been very similar styles of dressing across the upper classes of Europe, and the development of distinctive national styles. These remained very different until a counter-movement in the 17th to 18th centuries imposed similar styles once again, mostly originating from Ancien R��gime France.[11] Though the rich usually led fashion, the increasing affluence of early modern Europe led to the bourgeoisie and even peasants following trends at a distance sometimes uncomfortably close for the elites���a factor Braudel regards as one of the main motors of changing fashion.[12] Albrecht D��rer's drawing contrasts a well turned out bourgeoise from Nuremberg (left) with her counterpart from Venice. The Venetian lady's high chopines make her look taller. Ten 16th century portraits of German or Italian gentlemen may show ten entirely different hats, and at this period national differences were at their most pronounced, as Albrecht D��rer recorded in his actual or composite contrast of Nuremberg and Venetian fashions at the close of the 15th century (illustration, right). The "Spanish style" of the end of the century began the move back to synchronicity among upper-class Europeans, and after a struggle in the mid 17th century, French styles decisively took over leadership, a process completed in the 18th century.[13] Though colors and patterns of textiles changed from year to year,[14] the cut of a gentleman's coat and the length of his waistcoat, or the pattern to which a lady's dress was cut changed more slowly. Men's fashions largely derived from military models, and changes in a European male silhouette are galvanized in theaters of European war, where gentleman officers had opportunities to make notes of foreign styles: an example is the "Steinkirk" cravat or necktie. Marie Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI, leader of fashion The pace of change picked up in the 1780s with the increased publication of French engravings that showed the latest Paris styles; though there had been distribution of dressed dolls from France as patterns since the 16th century, and Abraham Bosse had produced engravings of fashion from the 1620s. By 1800, all Western Europeans were dressing alike (or thought they were): local variation became first a sign of provincial culture, and then a badge of the conservative peasant.[15] Although tailors and dressmakers were no doubt responsible for many innovations before, and the textile industry certainly led many trends, the history of fashion design is normally taken to date from 1858, when the English-born Charles Frederick Worth opened the first true haute couture house in Paris. The Haute house was the name established by government for the fashion houses that met the standards of industry. They have to adhere to standards such as: keeping at least 20 employees engaged in making the clothes, showing two collections per year at fashion shows, and presenting a certain number of patterns to costumers.[16] Since then the professional designer has become a progressively more dominant figure, despite the origins of many fashions in street fashion. For women the flapper styles of the 1920s marked the most major alteration in styles for several centuries, with a drastic shortening of skirt lengths and much looser-fitting clothes; with occasional revivals of long skirts, variations of the shorter length have remained dominant ever since. Flappers also wore cloches, which were snug fitting and covered the forehead. Her shoes had a heel and some sort of buckle. The most important part was the jewelry, such as: earrings and necklaces that had diamonds or gems. The flapper gave a particular image as being seductive due to her short length dress, which was form fitting, and the large amounts of rich jewelery around her neck.

Ten 16th century portraits of German or Italian gentlemen may show ten entirely different hats, and at this period national differences were at their most pronounced, as Albrecht D��rer recorded in his actual or composite contrast of Nuremberg and Venetian fashions at the close of the 15th century (illustration, right). The "Spanish style" of the end of the century began the move back to synchronicity among upper-class Europeans, and after a struggle in the mid 17th century, French styles decisively took over leadership, a process completed in the 18th century.[13] Though colors and patterns of textiles changed from year to year,[14] the cut of a gentleman's coat and the length of his waistcoat, or the pattern to which a lady's dress was cut changed more slowly. Men's fashions largely derived from military models, and changes in a European male silhouette are galvanized in theaters of European war, where gentleman officers had opportunities to make notes of foreign styles: an example is the "Steinkirk" cravat or necktie. Marie Antoinette, wife of Louis XVI, leader of fashion The pace of change picked up in the 1780s with the increased publication of French engravings that showed the latest Paris styles; though there had been distribution of dressed dolls from France as patterns since the 16th century, and Abraham Bosse had produced engravings of fashion from the 1620s. By 1800, all Western Europeans were dressing alike (or thought they were): local variation became first a sign of provincial culture, and then a badge of the conservative peasant.[15] Although tailors and dressmakers were no doubt responsible for many innovations before, and the textile industry certainly led many trends, the history of fashion design is normally taken to date from 1858, when the English-born Charles Frederick Worth opened the first true haute couture house in Paris. The Haute house was the name established by government for the fashion houses that met the standards of industry. They have to adhere to standards such as: keeping at least 20 employees engaged in making the clothes, showing two collections per year at fashion shows, and presenting a certain number of patterns to costumers.[16] Since then the professional designer has become a progressively more dominant figure, despite the origins of many fashions in street fashion. For women the flapper styles of the 1920s marked the most major alteration in styles for several centuries, with a drastic shortening of skirt lengths and much looser-fitting clothes; with occasional revivals of long skirts, variations of the shorter length have remained dominant ever since. Flappers also wore cloches, which were snug fitting and covered the forehead. Her shoes had a heel and some sort of buckle. The most important part was the jewelry, such as: earrings and necklaces that had diamonds or gems. The flapper gave a particular image as being seductive due to her short length dress, which was form fitting, and the large amounts of rich jewelery around her neck.

New FHA Reverse Mortgage For Seniors http://www.sookshopinimpone.net/1429/113/225/1030/2126.12tt61734884AAF11.php Unsub- http://www.sookshopinimpone.net/1429/113/225/1030/2126.12tt61734884AAF12.html A new missile is carried during a mass military parade at the Kim Il Sung Square in Pyongyang, North Korea.APNorth Korea is nearing completion of a light-water reactor that is primarily intended to generate electricity but which could add to concern over its nuclear program, a U.S.-based institute said Wednesday.Satellite photos, the latest taken this month, show the North appears to be putting finishing external touches to the reactor at its Yongbyon nuclear complex, according to 38 North, the website of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. The reactor could potentially begin operation within a year or so, although considerable technical hurdles remain, 38 North says in its analysis.Light-water reactors are best-suited for electricity generation, and U.S. academics who visited the site in 2010 when construction of the reactor began said it appeared designed for that purpose. It might be adapted to produce plutonium for weapons, but North Korea already has what's known as a gas-graphite reactor, which provides an easier option for making bomb fuel.North Korea announced in early April it was restarting the older reactor from which it is estimated to have derived enough plutonium for a half-dozen bombs before it was shuttered in 2007 during aid-for-disarmament negotiations. The announcement came amid a torrent of war threats from Pyongyang after the U.N. Security Council tightened particularly on border security, could help Obama sell the immigration overhaul in the U.S., particularly to wary Republicans. GOP lawmakers have long insisted the U.S. must focus its efforts on securing the border before addressing the legal status of the more than 11 million immigrants in the country illegally.The immigration bill being debated in the Senate would strengthen border security, allow tens of thousands of new high- and low-skilled workers into the country, require all employers to check their workers' legal status and provide an eventual path to citizenship for most of the immigrants in the U.S. illegally.More than half of the immigrants in the U.S. illegally are from Mexico, according to the Pew Research Center.Following a speech Friday to Mexican entrepreneurs, Obama will travel to Costa Rica, his first visit as president to the Central American nation. In addition to meetings with Costa Rican President Laura Chincilla, Obama will attend a gathering of leaders from the Central American Integration system. The regional network also includes the leaders of Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Panama.On Saturday, Obama will attend a business conference aimed at fostering economic cooperation between the U.S. and Central American nations. The president is due back in Washington Saturday night.
