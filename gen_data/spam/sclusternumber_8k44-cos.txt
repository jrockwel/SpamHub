 How Fatima Started Islam   A book like no other on this earth.  Not a few cartoons or an infantile movie trailer but 234 page novel which insults Islam like no other.  A parody of the always drunk proprietor of "Mohammad's Saloon & Brothel" with his completely ridiculous life exposed.  This moronic child molestating coward and fool who bumps his way through life oblivious to his manipulation as the figurehead of another new religion.  Learn about his adopted son and heir Ali, the biggest swish ever to sashay across Arabia while sadistically running Mecca's largest boy's brothel.  Only $9.99 to laugh at, mock, and ridicule those fanatics who do not enjoy being ridiculed.  A well written and extremely funny parody at Amazon.com.    link to Amazon.com https://www.amazon.com/How-Fatima-Started-Islam-Mohammads/dp/0578032902/ref Observe the never sober Mohammad having sex with camels, pre-adolescent girls and boys, the mutilations, murders, terrorism, sneak attacks, back stabbings and mental illnesses.  Absolutely no other novel is similar.  Stick up for America by sticking it to Radical Islam.   Also: There is a subtle effort to dissuade Americans from buying or reading this parody.  The Mullahs of Radical Islam HATE the fact that we in the West can still purchase this book.  They are pressuring and threatening Amazon to stop offering the novel for sale.  They demand a world wide ban with criminal penalties under Sharia Law.  Out of 6,000,000 Amazon books "How Fatima Started Islam" has the second lowest review rating, why, because Amazon has been flooded with well over 100 negative reviews with the lowest possible rating, reviewers who openly state that they would never ever buy or read a book insulting The Prophet, yet they take the time to tell you not to read it.  The second lowest rating is a badge of honor, it shows how much the Ayatollahs of BAGHDAD and DAMASCUS and the murderous terrorist who killed our ambassador and burned our embassy in BENGHAZI  do not want you to buy HFSI. Do not let these radical tin pot madmen, who think they rule the world and everyone in it, dictate to you what you may or may not read; purchase this important, well written, and extremely funny book.

*Premier Brands (BRND) rocks the red-hot $100 billion energy drink market - and Wall Street* *A profit opportunity this powerful hasn't popped up since Hansen soared 4,695% with the launch of Monster Energy and turned $25,000 into millions. Premier Brands (BRND) packs the same dynamite profit potential for investors. The company owns the next-big-thing in energy drinks. And is building an empire penetrating not just a $100 billion market, but a $795 billion market.* Suddenly, whether or not you call your broker about this innovative consumer-product incubator, *Premier Brands' (BRND)* share price could be on its way from $1.00 to double digits. By then, Wall Street will probably catch on. And with the attention, profit-thirsty traders could be guzzling BRND to cash in on the massive energy drink market, giving early birds like you another sudden giant leap toward its Hansen-like profit target. I' m Eric Dany and I have been making people rich for years with recent picks like Genova Energy up +488%, Chicago Pizza up 326%, and Genzyme up +272% but I think Premier Brands can blow them all away with Hansen like surges reaching 4000%. I'm going to show you why I believe a single $5,000 investment in BRND could balloon to $50,000 by the end of the year. And longer term, that same $5,000 could mushroom into $250,000 or more... the way Hansen did when it introduced Monster Energy. This low-priced (under $1 for now) blockbuster has everything going for it. Next-generation products rocking the red-hot $100 billion beverage market. Cutting-edge nutraceutical consumer products tapping into a $641 billion market, including exclusivity for a line of high-demand vitamins. Superior management led by the man who wrote the book on building beverage empires, Jorge Olson. If you were a beverage executive, just learning that Jorge Olson is Premier's new President would have you on the phone with your broker before you read the next paragraph. You'd have all the confidence in the world that his young company could be capable of turning *every $5,000 into $50,000 very quickly and potentially more than $200,000 in profit longer term.* And if you were in the industry, you'd know that Premier's marketing-distribution channel gives all its products an extraordinary advantage - the company's cutting-edge products enjoy a near-exclusive pipeline to high-traffic stores competitors can't penetrate. Premier Brands opened more than 1,000 retail accounts, in just 3 months, including: ** 7-Eleven Circle K Walgreens Arco AM/PM Valero, Shell Plus rock-solid relationships with hundreds of thousands of independent supermarkets and convenience stores saturating America... and Mexico! Convenience stores, known in the business as c-stores, ring up about $54.3 billion in sales each year. The fastest-growing products in c-stores include ready-to-drink coffee, sports drinks and energy drinks. And Premier is flooding their c-store distribution pipeline with products today's consumers demand: energy drinks, vitamin drinks, sports drinks and more. I'll tell you about these profit drivers in a moment. First, let me tell you about the man driving the company to new heights. Jorge Olson is not just another beverage industry executive, you see. He wrote the book that inspired Premier Brands and thousands of others in the industry, _*Build Your Beverage Empire*_. And Mr. Olson is more fired up for breakthrough success than ever. He comes to Premier with 10 years of C-level management experience and he's already: Launched more than 1,000 different consumer products Owned several distribution companies, as well as 3 consumer-goods companies Exported consumer goods to Mexico, including 5-Hour Energy, Rockstar Energy Drink and Monster Energy Drink Sold to convenience stores, supermarkets and pharmacies throughout America Served as advisor to consumer goods companies as well as institutional investors This might be the first you've heard of Jorge Olson. However he has advised companies like Wells Fargo, Prudential, Fidelity, Chase and many more... Coke, Pepsi, Hansen, Dr. Pepper, Snapple... *they've all paid Olson to advise them.* If you're ready to put major money on a stock, or an entrepreneur wanting to buy or launch a beverage, Jorge would probably be your first call. The reason... More than 6,000 beverage executives subscribe to his industry newsletters, including executives from Red Bull, Monster Energy, Fiji Water, Rockstar Energy, Dr. Pepper, Snapple Group, Vitamin Water, Frito-Lay, Hershey's, even Emergen-C and 5-Hour Energy and dozens more. He has worked on projects with several of these companies - plus Proctor & Gamble, SAB Miller Beer and other high-profile fortune companies. Almost all the energy-drink stars tapped into Olson's uncanny knack for identifying blockbuster beverages ahead of almost everyone else... and bringing them to market. But when Olson discovered Premier's unique energy product, ZizZazz, he saw so much potential he not only advised the company, he became the company's President. Are you starting to see what I see? ZizZazz has the potential to turn every* $5,000 into $50,000 quickly and more than $200,000 in profit longer term. *And that means... "ZizZazz" is my new way of saying _"Hurray!"_ It's also the name of Premier Brand's cutting-edge product, *ZizZazz Explosive Energy Drink Mix*. This product breakthrough is huge, for Premier Brands and its early investors. Jorge Olson says this is "the next big thing in energy drinks" because... ZizZazz Energy is new and unique. It packs the powerful get-up-and-go punch energy drinkers crave, but in a stick, like dynamite. It's in powdered format. _Jorge's secret_: "Don't compete in a category, create a category!" He adds, "We're launching a new category of product called the Powder Category." That's why I believe this is your chance to potentially make *10 times* your money before this year is over, and a mind-blowing *40 times* your money in the years to come. Act now! Talk to your broker about BRND today. You see, instead of creating another energy drink, or another energy shot and going head to head against billion-dollar companies, *Premier is launching a new "delivery system"* that will take the industry by storm. The company is creating a portfolio of products in ready to drink, individually packed sticks. Each energy stick delivers an explosive 200 mg of caffeine. This delicious dynamite can be mixed with water. Or taken straight, like candy. And it's delicious! ZizZazz Explosive Energy comes in four wildly popular flavors: pomegranate mango, cherry lime, tangerine and lemon raspberry. Tasty as it is, ZizZazz is almost sugar free, less than 1g of sugar, And because of that, there's no "crash" afterwards. Consumers of all ages love it... even those on diets. Besides giving consumers an instant and lasting energy jolt, this cutting-edge product is also loaded with good-for-you vitamins, including A, C, E, B1, B5, B6, B12, green tea, Rhodioa roses and Ginseng. Today's label-reading consumers won't find a single reason not to use ZizZazz. If you like a lot of bang for your buck, you'll love all the... *Unlike other energy drinks, ZizZazz doesn't need refrigeration. *This makes it much cheaper to package, ship, display in stores, purchase and consume ZizZazz does not require a lot of space to store so there is a lot of savings in storage. And shipping is downright cheap. It could cost $40.00 to ship just one case of energy drinks across the country - *but 24 cases of ZizZazz can be shipped for that same price, enough to stock 24 stores!* ZizZazz is placed in stores where consumers see it instantly - at the counter and on the refrigerator doors next to the water. In fact, ZizZazz is the only energy drink that can be displayed and sold at the counter, right next to the register, which is the hottest real estate in any store. The energy sticks are flying off the shelves in thousands of convenience stores right now. And Premier just signed a contract with the sales agent who's famous for selling into Walmart, Sam's Club, and Target. Sure to follow - Walgreens, Kroger, Costco, CVS, GNC, and Vitamin Shop, too. They'll all want to carry the hottest new beverage breakthrough, too. Acting on this information today could easily make you a fortune off a modest BRND buy. Plus, Premier is now in position to add more than 150,000 additional independent retailers in Mexico, often dubbed the "thirstiest" nation in the world because it is the largest consumer of soda per person on earth. Are you energized over owning BRND yet? Can you see why you could turn *every $5,000 into $50,000 quickly and potentially reward yourself with more than $200,000 in profit longer term.* Now is your chance to grab this opportunity - before it's too late. And there's more! in Mexico alone... Energy-drink sales have been on fire for years, growing up to 75% a year in the United States. In Mexico, growth is 200% a year. The red-hot Mexican beverage market is up for grabs and Premier is in line to snatch up big chunks of market share. Let me tell you why. Monster and Rockstar are struggling to penetrate the Mexican market that's now dominated by Red Bull's astounding 90% market share. But ZizZazz could easily steal customers away from Red Bull. Premier's secret: 75% of beverage sales in Mexico happen in mini markets and mom-and-pop stores and gas stations. This is Premier's unique strength - convenience store (c-store) distribution, a market channel that's always been difficult for competitors to penetrate, especially in Mexico. But one mastered by Premier and Jorge Olson. Now are you beginning to see why I call BRND the perfect stock? And why people like you could stand to make *1,000% quickly turning into a 4,000% return, similar to the stellar performance of Monster Energy.* Just in case, let me give you some background, so you can put Premier's astounding potential in perspective. Red Bull kicked off the energy-drink explosion in 1997, when a 12-ounce can of Coke sold for 50. Distributors and retailers laughed at Red Bull's $1.99 price - for a tiny 8-ounce can, no less. Now Red Bull is the one laughing - all the way to the bank - with $4 billion in sales each year. Imagine that! *From zero in sales to $4 billion since 1997*. But you couldn't profit because Red Bull is private. The first chance for people to make money off the energy drink explosion came when publicly traded Hansen Natural launched a 16-ounce can of get-up-and-go called Monster Energy. Ordinary people became wealthy as Hansen soared 4,695%. Today, Hansen's Monster Energy is actually distributed by Coke. Then 5-Hour Energy had retailers and distributors doubled over in laughter again in 2005. Who would pay $3 for a 2-ounce bottle? That's crazy, or so they thought. Ha, ha. Now, just seven years later, 5-Hour is ringing up around $1 billion in sales per year, according to The Wall Street Journal. But 5-Hour isn't a good opportunity because like Red Bull, 5-Hour Energy is private, too. *Pent-up demand alone could send Premier Brands (BRND) through the clouds* Until now, fast-profit seeking people have been shut out. BRND is the first chance for regular people to get rich off the massive explosion of energy drinks since Hansen. You see, of the top 5 energy drinks, 2 are private, 2 are absorbed in the giant beverage portfolios of Coke and Pepsi, and then there's Hansen Natural, which, as I mentioned, is now distributed by Coke. Hansen's Monster Energy stock jumped 12% in one day, on April 30, 2012, when it came out that Coke might be buying it. But Monster's mega-spike days are over. _*Don't forget, it has already rewarded its followers with profits greater than 4,000%. *_And if Coke buys it outright, well, giant blue chips like Coke rarely (if ever) create explosive profits. *BRND is poised to catapult investors into the 1,000%+ Winners Club this year. Call your broker today!* Take a look at the top 5 selling energy drinks and the company's that own them. Not much of a buy list for people seeking big fat fast profits, it is? Privately Owned Owned by Hansen Natural Privately Owned Owned by Coca Cola Owned by Pepsi New on the market: MioEnergy. It's an energy mix, too, like ZizZazz and selling fast, too, like ZizZazz. But MioEnergy is a liquid. What's more, it's owned by blue-chip Kraft Foods, already a giant company, like Coke and Pepsi. Growth is not explosive. Neither are profits. I believe BRND is the first chance for ordinary folks to get rich off the massive explosion of energy drinks since Hansen benefited from pent-up demand and shot up over 4,000%. Monster won't reward folks with another 4,000% surge any time soon. Neither will Coke or Pepsi. But Premier Brands could and then BRND could keep on climbing over 4,000% higher, the way Hansen did. Coke and Pepsi are well aware of Jorge Olson's remarkable track record, which leads me to think takeover rumors could be brewing as you read this. According to CLSA analyst Caroline Levy, Coke is deploying capital strategically, and she notes that the company's energy portfolio is lacking, a hole that could only likely be plugged by the purchase of major brand like Monster (likely) or Red Bull (likely not for sale). *And when Coke and Pepsi spend, they spend big!* Coke bought Vitaminwater for more than $4 billion Coke paid $43 million for 40% of Honest Tea in 2008 and a few months ago scooped up the other 60% for an undisclosed sum. Coke paid $750 million for Fuse Coke shelled out $715 million just for the distribution rights for Dr. Pepper-Snapple Group. Pepsi acquired Tropicana for $3.5 billion Pepsi just bought out V Water for an undisclosed sum, which you can bet was a boatload of bucks. Pepsi, Coke, or even a pharmaceutical company could get into a bidding war over Premier Brands (BRND). Pfizer just this year paid a rumored $1 billion for Emergen-C, a powdered vitamin mix that sells more than $150 million a year and, by the way, Emergen-C is one of the companies Premier's CEO *Jorge Olson* consulted. Should a bidding war for BRND erupt, you'll be kicking yourself if you don't act on this information today. But even if takeover talks stall or fail to develop, you'll still be sitting pretty owning BRND. The reason, and it's the main reason I expect people who act early on BRND* will get ten times, if not 100 times returned in long term profits.* Under the leadership of Mr. Olson, BRND looks to keep climbing up the charts as Premier Brands continues to grab bigger shares of: the $641 billion drug, cosmetic and toiletry wholesaling industry the $100 billion beverage industry and the $54 billion in sales rung up just by convenience stores stretching across America. *_That's a $795 billion pie and Premier Brands is hungry._* The energy drink market alone could propel BRND up the chart in a hurry. But the company gives regular market participants many more reasons to cheer. The ZizZazz product line also captures sports and fitness enthusiasts, as well as the fast growing segment of the population that's hyper health conscious. This would include America's Baby Boomers... their children... and their grandchildren. Coke and Pepsi offer nothing like this: Premier's *ZizZazz Extreme Fitness Formula* provides sports and fitness enthusiasts with essential ingredients that maximize workouts. The company even has a vitamin breakthrough that's targeted to children. This could heighten takeover talks not just from Coke and Pepsi but from drug companies, too. In addition to ZizZazz Extreme Energy and ZizZazz Extreme Fitness, Premier Brands also owns a breakthrough product for kids. It's called Kidz Zazz and kids love it because it tastes like candy. Parents love buying it for their children because Kidz Zazz is actually a potent multivitamin that supplies all the essential nutrients growing kids need, but don't always get from the foods they eat. But Jorge Olson's empire building doesn't stop with ZizZazz. Premier is also tapping into the massive vitamin market not just with Kidz Zazz, but also with the exclusive distribution rights to the Make Me line of vitamins, including *Make Me Vitamin C* and *Make Me Multivitamin*. With America's population aging (11,000 Baby Boomers a day will turn age 65 for the next 17 years!), an increased concern over health is already underway. And with medical costs rising, folks are quickly gravitating to products that offer health benefits. And now they can! The Make Me line of vitamins comes in powdered format, just like the ZizZazz product line and just like Emergen-C, which drug giant Pfizer just bought from Alacer this year for a rumored $1 billion. Emergen-C sells more than $150 million worth of the powdered vitamin per year. But Emergen-C lacks the powerful c-store distribution channel Premier has built. As a result, Premier's powdered vitamin mixes reach a mass market Emergen-C does not. Premier Brands makes for an even better takeover target because it offers not one brand, but a host of brands consumers love. Coke? Pepsi? Pfizer? Any one of them might want Premier Brand's breakthrough products. Premier Brands already has a healthy product line enjoying robust margins of 20% to 70% across the board with its: Now factor in the future and bam - you're looking at the perfect stock. BRND could quickly turn $5,000 into a ten-bagger and could reward people who act early with $200,000 profit longer term. Another reason BRND is destined to soar: _*Up to 20 new brands each month contact Premier Brands for its distribution expertise.*_ BRND is new to the market and low priced. BRND is set to surge as demand for a way to cash in on today's explosive energy drink market is satisfied, the way Hansen did. BRND is managed by the man who wrote the book on building beverage empires BRND is ripe for a takeover that could shower shareholders with a massive profit windfall. All this is in place whether or not you call your broker about BRND. You can beat Wall Street to the early profits for a change, but only if you act on the information I've passed on to you here and call your broker. This isnt the first time Ive alerted ordinary folks to astounding profits. Ive been making readers rich for years. But Premier Brands (BRND) could blow them all away with Hansen-like surges reaching 4.000%. As I've outlined, my conservative estimate shows early BRND investors can quickly turn *their modest offerings into something much greater*. That's why I call *BRND the perfect stock*. See what your broker thinks - today! Don't wait. *Premier Brands (BRND)* share price could suddenly start jumping its way from $1.00 to double digits... with or without you. *Don't miss out.* It won't be "early" forever. You need to get in on this action NOW Few stocks have the potential to turn $5,000 into $50,000 within months. Premier Brands can, the way Hansen did when it introduced Monster Energy, which is why you should call your broker about BRND today.

Today's label-reading consumers won't find a single reason not to use ZizZazz. If you like a lot of bang for your buck, you'll love all the... *Unlike other energy drinks, ZizZazz doesn't need refrigeration. *This makes it much cheaper to package, ship, display in stores, purchase and consume ZizZazz does not require a lot of space to store so there is a lot of savings in storage. And shipping is downright cheap. It could cost $40.00 to ship just one case of energy drinks across the country - *but 24 cases of ZizZazz can be shipped for that same price, enough to stock 24 stores!* ZizZazz is placed in stores where consumers see it instantly - at the counter and on the refrigerator doors next to the water. In fact, ZizZazz is the only energy drink that can be displayed and sold at the counter, right next to the register, which is the hottest real estate in any store. The energy sticks are flying off the shelves in thousands of convenience stores right now. And Premier just signed a contract with the sales agent who's famous for selling into Walmart, Sam's Club, and Target. Sure to follow - Walgreens, Kroger, Costco, CVS, GNC, and Vitamin Shop, too. They'll all want to carry the hottest new beverage breakthrough, too. Acting on this information today could easily make you a fortune off a modest BRND buy. Plus, Premier is now in position to add more than 150,000 additional independent retailers in Mexico, often dubbed the "thirstiest" nation in the world because it is the largest consumer of soda per person on earth. Are you energized over owning BRND yet? Can you see why you could turn *every $5,000 into $50,000 quickly and potentially reward yourself with more than $200,000 in profit longer term.* Now is your chance to grab this opportunity - before it's too late. And there's more! in Mexico alone... Energy-drink sales have been on fire for years, growing up to 75% a year in the United States. In Mexico, growth is 200% a year. The red-hot Mexican beverage market is up for grabs and Premier is in line to snatch up big chunks of market share. Let me tell you why. Monster and Rockstar are struggling to penetrate the Mexican market that's now dominated by Red Bull's astounding 90% market share. But ZizZazz could easily steal customers away from Red Bull. Premier's secret: 75% of beverage sales in Mexico happen in mini markets and mom-and-pop stores and gas stations. This is Premier's unique strength - convenience store (c-store) distribution, a market channel that's always been difficult for competitors to penetrate, especially in Mexico. But one mastered by Premier and Jorge Olson. Now are you beginning to see why I call BRND the perfect stock? And why people like you could stand to make *1,000% quickly turning into a 4,000% return, similar to the stellar performance of Monster Energy.* Just in case, let me give you some background, so you can put Premier's astounding potential in perspective. Red Bull kicked off the energy-drink explosion in 1997, when a 12-ounce can of Coke sold for 50. Distributors and retailers laughed at Red Bull's $1.99 price - for a tiny 8-ounce can, no less. Now Red Bull is the one laughing - all the way to the bank - with $4 billion in sales each year. Imagine that! *From zero in sales to $4 billion since 1997*. But you couldn't profit because Red Bull is private. The first chance for people to make money off the energy drink explosion came when publicly traded Hansen Natural launched a 16-ounce can of get-up-and-go called Monster Energy. Ordinary people became wealthy as Hansen soared 4,695%. Today, Hansen's Monster Energy is actually distributed by Coke. Then 5-Hour Energy had retailers and distributors doubled over in laughter again in 2005. Who would pay $3 for a 2-ounce bottle? That's crazy, or so they thought. Ha, ha. Now, just seven years later, 5-Hour is ringing up around $1 billion in sales per year, according to The Wall Street Journal. But 5-Hour isn't a good opportunity because like Red Bull, 5-Hour Energy is private, too. *Pent-up demand alone could send Premier Brands (BRND) through the clouds* Until now, fast-profit seeking people have been shut out. BRND is the first chance for regular people to get rich off the massive explosion of energy drinks since Hansen. You see, of the top 5 energy drinks, 2 are private, 2 are absorbed in the giant beverage portfolios of Coke and Pepsi, and then there's Hansen Natural, which, as I mentioned, is now distributed by Coke. Hansen's Monster Energy stock jumped 12% in one day, on April 30, 2012, when it came out that Coke might be buying it. But Monster's mega-spike days are over. _*Don't forget, it has already rewarded its followers with profits greater than 4,000%. *_And if Coke buys it outright, well, giant blue chips like Coke rarely (if ever) create explosive profits. *BRND is poised to catapult investors into the 1,000%+ Winners Club this year. Call your broker today!* Take a look at the top 5 selling energy drinks and the company's that own them. Not much of a buy list for people seeking big fat fast profits, it is? Privately Owned Owned by Hansen Natural Privately Owned Owned by Coca Cola Owned by Pepsi New on the market: MioEnergy. It's an energy mix, too, like ZizZazz and selling fast, too, like ZizZazz. But MioEnergy is a liquid. What's more, it's owned by blue-chip Kraft Foods, already a giant company, like Coke and Pepsi. Growth is not explosive. Neither are profits. I believe BRND is the first chance for ordinary folks to get rich off the massive explosion of energy drinks since Hansen benefited from pent-up demand and shot up over 4,000%. Monster won't reward folks with another 4,000% surge any time soon. Neither will Coke or Pepsi. But Premier Brands could and then BRND could keep on climbing over 4,000% higher, the way Hansen did. Coke and Pepsi are well aware of Jorge Olson's remarkable track record, which leads me to think takeover rumors could be brewing as you read this. According to CLSA analyst Caroline Levy, Coke is deploying capital strategically, and she notes that the company's energy portfolio is lacking, a hole that could only likely be plugged by the purchase of major brand like Monster (likely) or Red Bull (likely not for sale). *And when Coke and Pepsi spend, they spend big!* Coke bought Vitaminwater for more than $4 billion Coke paid $43 million for 40% of Honest Tea in 2008 and a few months ago scooped up the other 60% for an undisclosed sum. Coke paid $750 million for Fuse Coke shelled out $715 million just for the distribution rights for Dr. Pepper-Snapple Group. Pepsi acquired Tropicana for $3.5 billion Pepsi just bought out V Water for an undisclosed sum, which you can bet was a boatload of bucks. Pepsi, Coke, or even a pharmaceutical company could get into a bidding war over Premier Brands (BRND). Pfizer just this year paid a rumored $1 billion for Emergen-C, a powdered vitamin mix that sells more than $150 million a year and, by the way, Emergen-C is one of the companies Premier's CEO *Jorge Olson* consulted. Should a bidding war for BRND erupt, you'll be kicking yourself if you don't act on this information today. But even if takeover talks stall or fail to develop, you'll still be sitting pretty owning BRND. The reason, and it's the main reason I expect people who act early on BRND* will get ten times, if not 100 times returned in long term profits.* Under the leadership of Mr. Olson, BRND looks to keep climbing up the charts as Premier Brands continues to grab bigger shares of: the $641 billion drug, cosmetic and toiletry wholesaling industry the $100 billion beverage industry and the $54 billion in sales rung up just by convenience stores stretching across America. *_That's a $795 billion pie and Premier Brands is hungry._* The energy drink market alone could propel BRND up the chart in a hurry. But the company gives regular market participants many more reasons to cheer. The ZizZazz product line also captures sports and fitness enthusiasts, as well as the fast growing segment of the population that's hyper health conscious. This would include America's Baby Boomers... their children... and their grandchildren. Coke and Pepsi offer nothing like this: Premier's *ZizZazz Extreme Fitness Formula* provides sports and fitness enthusiasts with essential ingredients that maximize workouts. The company even has a vitamin breakthrough that's targeted to children. This could heighten takeover talks not just from Coke and Pepsi but from drug companies, too. In addition to ZizZazz Extreme Energy and ZizZazz Extreme Fitness, Premier Brands also owns a breakthrough product for kids. It's called Kidz Zazz and kids love it because it tastes like candy. Parents love buying it for their children because Kidz Zazz is actually a potent multivitamin that supplies all the essential nutrients growing kids need, but don't always get from the foods they eat. But Jorge Olson's empire building doesn't stop with ZizZazz. Premier is also tapping into the massive vitamin market not just with Kidz Zazz, but also with the exclusive distribution rights to the Make Me line of vitamins, including *Make Me Vitamin C* and *Make Me Multivitamin*. With America's population aging (11,000 Baby Boomers a day will turn age 65 for the next 17 years!), an increased concern over health is already underway. And with medical costs rising, folks are quickly gravitating to products that offer health benefits. And now they can! The Make Me line of vitamins comes in powdered format, just like the ZizZazz product line and just like Emergen-C, which drug giant Pfizer just bought from Alacer this year for a rumored $1 billion. Emergen-C sells more than $150 million worth of the powdered vitamin per year. But Emergen-C lacks the powerful c-store distribution channel Premier has built. As a result, Premier's powdered vitamin mixes reach a mass market Emergen-C does not. Premier Brands makes for an even better takeover target because it offers not one brand, but a host of brands consumers love. Coke? Pepsi? Pfizer? Any one of them might want Premier Brand's breakthrough products. Premier Brands already has a healthy product line enjoying robust margins of 20% to 70% across the board with its: Now factor in the future and bam - you're looking at the perfect stock. BRND could quickly turn $5,000 into a ten-bagger and could reward people who act early with $200,000 profit longer term. Another reason BRND is destined to soar: _*Up to 20 new brands each month contact Premier Brands for its distribution expertise.*_ BRND is new to the market and low priced. BRND is set to surge as demand for a way to cash in on today's explosive energy drink market is satisfied, the way Hansen did. BRND is managed by the man who wrote the book on building beverage empires BRND is ripe for a takeover that could shower shareholders with a massive profit windfall. All this is in place whether or not you call your broker about BRND. You can beat Wall Street to the early profits for a change, but only if you act on the information I've passed on to you here and call your broker. This isnt the first time Ive alerted ordinary folks to astounding profits. Ive been making readers rich for years. But Premier Brands (BRND) could blow them all away with Hansen-like surges reaching 4.000%. As I've outlined, my conservative estimate shows early BRND investors can quickly turn *their modest offerings into something much greater*. That's why I call *BRND the perfect stock*. See what your broker thinks - today! Don't wait. *Premier Brands (BRND)* share price could suddenly start jumping its way from $1.00 to double digits... with or without you. *Don't miss out.* It won't be "early" forever. You need to get in on this action NOW Few stocks have the potential to turn $5,000 into $50,000 within months. Premier Brands can, the way Hansen did when it introduced Monster Energy, which is why you should call your broker about BRND today.

 Hallo Attached the corp. invoice for the period July 2012 til Aug. 2012. Thanks a lot MICHAL Bowen Aleris International Corp. 



 Hi Everyone, Very Exciting News for BRND! In a special press release immediately after market close today, it was revealed that Premier Brands, (BRND) our consumer soft-drink juggernaut, has signed an exclusive Marketing and Distribution agreement with Xymbiot, Inc. to develop and execute a branding and marketing plan for its Zimbi juice drinks whose website is here . This is on top of the deal BRND announced a few days ago with Make Me Drinks whose website is here! This is huge news, and puts BRND squarely in the middle of the creation of an entirely new market! Ziimbi is the only specialty drink of its kind anywhere targeting healthy, wholesome drinks directly to the youth market with innovative packaging kids can actually play with - a one-of-a-kind aerodynamic plastic bottle shaped like a rocket that actually flies up to 100 feet when thrown encouraging kids to recycle! Zimbi drinks are loaded with superfruits, anti-oxidants, and vitamins and are low in sugar and calories. Zimbi juice drinks are available in five flavors: Acai Raspberry, Apple Yumberry, Pomegranate Punch, Tropical Wolfberry, and Orange-Pina Camu Camu. Jorge Olson, President of Premier Brands, Inc. said, We have an opportunity to take the beverage market by surprise with Zimbi designing a marketing and branding strategy around the added-value of this delicious and healthier childrens beverage will hopefully make consumers, especially children, more mindful to recycle rather than simply to discard the bottle into the trash. And if anyone knows about marketing innovation, its beverage guru Jorge Olson. Everyone whos anyone in the beverage industry knows Jorges the man. Hes already responsible for getting BRND products into some of the largest stores in the nation, including 7-1, Circle K, Walgreens and Arco stores. Its a brilliant move for Zimbi and a major deal for BRND. Hurry before the stock is trading much higher soon! Investors are starting to take notice and BRND had record volume today of over 1.1 million shares. These numbers are unheard of, and points to the fact that BRND is building a solid base to launch its next leg up. As I said before, if you havent yet made the move into these shares or if youre considering adding to your position now is the time to do it. Once the market opens, we are expecing to see some major movement to the upside this may even be the catalyst to push this above dollar and keep it there. And from everything were seeing, from that point on, its through the roof! Make the move now, so youll be in position as soon as the market opens tomorrow as... *Premier Brands (BRND) rocks the red-hot $100 billion energy drink market - and Wall Street* ** Suddenly, whether or not you call your broker about this innovative consumer-product incubator, *Premier Brands' (BRND)* share price could be on its way from $1.00 to double digits. By then, Wall Street will probably catch on. And with the attention, profit-thirsty traders could be guzzling BRND to cash in on the massive energy drink market, giving early birds like you another sudden giant leap toward its Hansen-like profit target. I' m Eric Dany and I have been making people rich for years with recent picks like Genova Energy up +488%, Chicago Pizza up 326%, and Genzyme up +272% but I think Premier Brands can blow them all away with Hansen like surges reaching 4000%. I'm going to show you why I believe a single $5,000 investment in BRND could balloon to $50,000 by the end of the year. And longer term, that same $5,000 could mushroom into $250,000 or more... the way Hansen did when it introduced Monster Energy. This low-priced (under $1 for now) blockbuster has everything going for it. Next-generation products rocking the red-hot $100 billion beverage market. Cutting-edge nutraceutical consumer products tapping into a $641 billion market, including exclusivity for a line of high-demand vitamins. Superior management led by the man who wrote the book on building beverage empires, Jorge Olson. If you were a beverage executive, just learning that Jorge Olson is Premier's new President would have you on the phone with your broker before you read the next paragraph. You'd have all the confidence in the world that his young company could be capable of turning *every $5,000 into $50,000 very quickly and potentially more than $200,000 in profit longer term.* And if you were in the industry, you'd know that Premier's marketing-distribution channel gives all its products an extraordinary advantage - the company's cutting-edge products enjoy a near-exclusive pipeline to high-traffic stores competitors can't penetrate. Premier Brands opened more than 1,000 retail accounts, in just 3 months, including: ** 7-Eleven Circle K Walgreens Arco AM/PM Valero, Shell Plus rock-solid relationships with hundreds of thousands of independent supermarkets and convenience stores saturating America... and Mexico! Convenience stores, known in the business as c-stores, ring up about $54.3 billion in sales each year. The fastest-growing products in c-stores include ready-to-drink coffee, sports drinks and energy drinks. And Premier is flooding their c-store distribution pipeline with products today's consumers demand: energy drinks, vitamin drinks, sports drinks and more. I'll tell you about these profit drivers in a moment. First, let me tell you about the man driving the company to new heights. Jorge Olson is not just another beverage industry executive, you see. He wrote the book that inspired Premier Brands and thousands of others in the industry, _*Build Your Beverage Empire*_. And Mr. Olson is more fired up for breakthrough success than ever. He comes to Premier with 10 years of C-level management experience and he's already: Launched more than 1,000 different consumer products Owned several distribution companies, as well as 3 consumer-goods companies Exported consumer goods to Mexico, including 5-Hour Energy, Rockstar Energy Drink and Monster Energy Drink Sold to convenience stores, supermarkets and pharmacies throughout America Served as advisor to consumer goods companies as well as institutional investors This might be the first you've heard of Jorge Olson. However he has advised companies like Wells Fargo, Prudential, Fidelity, Chase and many more... Coke, Pepsi, Hansen, Dr. Pepper, Snapple... *they've all paid Olson to advise them.* If you're ready to put major money on a stock, or an entrepreneur wanting to buy or launch a beverage, Jorge would probably be your first call. The reason... More than 6,000 beverage executives subscribe to his industry newsletters, including executives from Red Bull, Monster Energy, Fiji Water, Rockstar Energy, Dr. Pepper, Snapple Group, Vitamin Water, Frito-Lay, Hershey's, even Emergen-C and 5-Hour Energy and dozens more. He has worked on projects with several of these companies - plus Proctor & Gamble, SAB Miller Beer and other high-profile fortune companies. Almost all the energy-drink stars tapped into Olson's uncanny knack for identifying blockbuster beverages ahead of almost everyone else... and bringing them to market. But when Olson discovered Premier's unique energy product, ZizZazz, he saw so much potential he not only advised the company, he became the company's President. Are you starting to see what I see? ZizZazz has the potential to turn every* $5,000 into $50,000 quickly and more than $200,000 in profit longer term. *And that means... "ZizZazz" is my new way of saying _"Hurray!"_ It's also the name of Premier Brand's cutting-edge product, *ZizZazz Explosive Energy Drink Mix*. This product breakthrough is huge, for Premier Brands and its early investors. Jorge Olson says this is "the next big thing in energy drinks" because... ZizZazz Energy is new and unique. It packs the powerful get-up-and-go punch energy drinkers crave, but in a stick, like dynamite. It's in powdered format. _Jorge's secret_: "Don't compete in a category, create a category!" He adds, "We're launching a new category of product called the Powder Category." That's why I believe this is your chance to potentially make *10 times* your money before this year is over, and a mind-blowing *40 times* your money in the years to come. Act now! Talk to your broker about BRND today. You see, instead of creating another energy drink, or another energy shot and going head to head against billion-dollar companies, *Premier is launching a new "delivery system"* that will take the industry by storm. The company is creating a portfolio of products in ready to drink, individually packed sticks. Each energy stick delivers an explosive 200 mg of caffeine. This delicious dynamite can be mixed with water. Or taken straight, like candy. And it's delicious! ZizZazz Explosive Energy comes in four wildly popular flavors: pomegranate mango, cherry lime, tangerine and lemon raspberry. Tasty as it is, ZizZazz is almost sugar free, less than 1g of sugar, And because of that, there's no "crash" afterwards. Consumers of all ages love it... even those on diets. Besides giving consumers an instant and lasting energy jolt, this cutting-edge product is also loaded with good-for-you vitamins, including A, C, E, B1, B5, B6, B12, green tea, Rhodioa roses and Ginseng. Today's label-reading consumers won't find a single reason not to use ZizZazz. If you like a lot of bang for your buck, you'll love all the... *Unlike other energy drinks, ZizZazz doesn't need refrigeration. *This makes it much cheaper to package, ship, display in stores, purchase and consume ZizZazz does not require a lot of space to store so there is a lot of savings in storage.

As I've outlined, my conservative estimate shows early BRND investors can quickly turn *their modest offerings into something much greater*. That's why I call *BRND the perfect stock*. See what your broker thinks - today! Don't wait. *Premier Brands (BRND)* share price could suddenly start jumping its way from $1.00 to double digits... with or without you. *Don't miss out.* It won't be "early" forever. You need to get in on this action NOW Few stocks have the potential to turn $5,000 into $50,000 within months. Premier Brands can, the way Hansen did when it introduced Monster Energy, which is why you should call your broker about BRND today.

 How Fatima Started Islam   A book like no other on this earth.  Not a few cartoons or an infantile movie trailer but 234 page novel which insults Islam like no other.  A parody of the always drunk proprietor of "Mohammad's Saloon & Brothel" with his completely ridiculous life exposed.  This moronic child molestating coward and fool who bumps his way through life oblivious to his manipulation as the figurehead of another new religion.  Learn about his adopted son and heir Ali, the biggest swish ever to sashay across Arabia while sadistically running Mecca's largest boy's brothel.  Only $9.99 to laugh at, mock, and ridicule those fanatics who do not enjoy being ridiculed.  A well written and extremely funny parody at Amazon.com.    link to Amazon.com https://www.amazon.com/How-Fatima-Started-Islam-Mohammads/dp/0578032902/ref Observe the never sober Mohammad having sex with camels, pre-adolescent girls and boys, the mutilations, murders, terrorism, sneak attacks, back stabbings and mental illnesses.  Absolutely no other novel is similar.  Stick up for America by sticking it to Radical Islam.   Also: There is a subtle effort to dissuade Americans from buying or reading this parody.  The Mullahs of Radical Islam HATE the fact that we in the West can still purchase this book.  They are pressuring and threatening Amazon to stop offering the novel for sale.  They demand a world wide ban with criminal penalties under Sharia Law.  Out of 6,000,000 Amazon books "How Fatima Started Islam" has the second lowest review rating, why, because Amazon has been flooded with well over 100 negative reviews with the lowest possible rating, reviewers who openly state that they would never ever buy or read a book insulting The Prophet, yet they take the time to tell you not to read it.  The second lowest rating is a badge of honor, it shows how much the Ayatollahs of BAGHDAD and DAMASCUS and the murderous terrorist who killed our ambassador and burned our embassy in BENGHAZI  do not want you to buy HFSI. Do not let these radical tin pot madmen, who think they rule the world and everyone in it, dictate to you what you may or may not read; purchase this important, well written, and extremely funny book.

As if MzU0OGE5ODhiNDNiNDNjOGM0YzQ3NWZkNWNiMTU1Nzc_ in answer to his 7160067143493877665 wish, the drops began to fall--slowly at first, then more copiously, till at last their clothing was saturated, and the boat partly filled with water. Eagerly they squeezed out the welcome dregs from their clothing, and felt a blessed relief. They filled two bottles they had remaining with the precious fluid. "If those poor fellows had only waited," said the captain. "They are out of suffering now," said Bunsby. The relief was only temporary, and they felt it to MzU0OGE5ODhiNDNiNDNjOGM0YzQ3NWZkNWNiMTU1Nzc_ be so. They were without food, and the two bottles of water would not last them long. Still, there was a slight return of hope, which survives under the most discouraging circumstances. CHAPTER XXVII. FRANK PRICE The ship _Argonaut_, bound for Calcutta, 13268766921921a6a2a475fd5cb15577 was speeding along with a fair wind, when the man at the lookout called: "Boat in sight!" "Where away?" The sailor pointed, out a small boat a mile distant, nearly in the ship's track, rising and falling with the billows. "Is there any one in MzU0OGE5ODhiNDNiNDNjOGM0YzQ3NWZkNWNiMTU1Nzc_ 1693142016 it?" "I see two men lying in the bottom. They are motionless. They may be dead." The boat was soon overtaken. It was the boat from the ill-fated _Norman_, Captain Rushton and Bunsby were lying stretched out in the bottom, both motionless and apparently without life. Bunsby was really dead. But there was still some life left in the captain, which, under the care of the surgeon of the ship, was carefully husbanded until he was out of immediate danger. But his system, from the long privation of food, had received such a shock, that his mind, sympathizing with it, he fell into a kind of stupor, mental and physical, and though strength and vigor came slowly back, Captain Rushton was in mind a child. Oblivion of the past seemed to have come over him. He did not remember who he was, or that he had a wife and child.

Auto-Price-Finder PO Box 316 Stoneham, MA 02180 This is good news, as some clients have not been allowed into the clinics because of hair colouring, it off gasses for some time. As for the chlorine my son Kris will go into a sneezing spat in chlorinated water (pools and hot tubs) and be coverd in hives untill he has had a long hot shower. Nice reminder thank you.I've suffered for hives over several years. From ages 8-12, 19-20, 25-31, 31-present (32). They would slowly come on, one or two a day, to the point that I was always suffering from them somewhere on my body. And then they would be gone. They would be worse under tight waisted jeans or cover my *** if I had to sit on hard chairs or bleachers for too long. I was so rellieved at 31 when they just disappeared again, but 8 months later when they came back they came back with a vengance. Previously, I had been able to take 'reactine' and this would keep them somewhat under control. This last time I could take 5 or 6 a day and find no relief. Contrary to all I've read running and working up a sweat or a hot shower pounding directly on trouble spots brought some relief. What has worked? - Colonics or as I affectionally call them "*** cleans" or more politically correct colon cleansing. I did a 5 day juice fast and 5 days of colonics. The reactine started to work again. I continued *** cleans every three or four days and have now stretched them out to once a month. With the colonics I have also been taking probiotics which seem to make the reactine work more effectively. I'm still not hive free, but life is bearable again. I take one reactine a day. I'm waiting to see a specialist to make sure all plumbing works. But if you find hives don't seem to match any allergies, make sure your body can push out the toxins that may be trying to come out your skin. Happy scratching.Hi, My hives started about 3 years ago and have continued to get worse. They are chronic and year-round and constant and oddly, only on my body from the waist up. I have hives constantly on my body, but sometimes they will go without itching for a couple of hours at a time. I went to the allergist and had all the skin ***** tests (I'm a little allergic to several things, but cutting back on the controllable ones, like milk, or dust, have had no effect) and have tried various allergy meds, such as Claritan, Allegra, Zyrtec, and now Xyzal. They take just a liitle of the itching off, but I still itch and still have hives. It's like torture, the constant itching. And for the life of me, I can't attribute it to any one thing, like showering, or exercising, or sun exposure. I live in two cities (Los Angeles and Sacramento) and it doesn't make a difference which one I'm in. My allergist is now saying the last thing to try is allergy shots. I just recently have been hearing about local honey, oil of oregano, perilla oil, and DIM. And now on here I read about Magnesium. I guess I was looking for someone with the same experience as me and who had tried any natural solutions, because I want off the drugs. This Xyzal seems to make me more drowsy than usual. I'm about to go out and purchase some of the above natural solutions (I've just started on the local honey yesterday) and would like to touch base with anyone else out there to continue to compare trials and errors in the hopes of finding some relief. I want to thank those of you who have posted so far, you've given me more potential ammunition. I found an NAET practitioner nearby and may go there if none of these other alternatives work. I don't relish the thought up starting up shots. Thanks for reading this. MargaretChronic hives: 3 years 1999-2002, Nov 2007 to present. http://chronichives.com/ is the best site I've found to cover chronic hives. In my case, they think it is Hashimoto's or other autoimmune thyroid, as blood tests show low TSH, and extremely high thyroid antibody counts, synthetic thyroid not helping though unfortunately, and has potentially bad interaction with Doxepin. Doxepin is anti-depresent drug that didn't really help depression, but had a curious side affect of stopping hives on some people, about 700 times more potent than benedryl. That said, not really stopping the hives for me. Get swelling in soft tissues too, including lips, eyes, stomach, and esophogus. External hives are general H1 (histamine 1), and zertec and other such treat. Zantac and other H2 (histamine 2) blockers block a different kind of histamine, so sometimes combining Zertec and Zantec (or their equivelants in other drugs) can help. Prednisone works for me, but I only take when I can't stand it, and usually a 10 day course at most once a month. I hear so many people talking about allergies, but many chronic hives cases are autoimmune (body attacking itself, could be from a virus that your body has developed and anti-body for that resembles something in your normal cell structure). If you have autoimmunie hives, you may also be susceptible to other autoimmunie problems (rheumatoid arthritis, Multiple Sclerosis, Lupus). Well, regardless of what I know about it, the most I know is I pretty much hate the things. A REALLY hot shower sometimes helps, as I think my whole body starts to react and then when I get out, I feel better. Other than that, it is usually Zertec in the morning, Doxepin at night, and benedryl as needed, with an EpiPen on hand in case one of these times the swelling in my throat gets to the point I can't breath.I recently encountered the same thing - I went to TN on vacation a few weeks ago and all of a sudden broke out first on my knees and legs and then a few days later, all over. I thought it was from the pool at the hotel we were staying at because that's where I was when it first started. After we got home, I still had the hives, and was eating dinner one night and all of a sudden everything moved up to my face and neck and it got hard to breathe... my mom is allergic to lemons (her throat closes up and she has difficulty breathing - she takes liquid benadryl anytime she has a reaction), and so that's what I was thinking that it had to be - that night I was eating dinner, the salad dressing I had included lemon, plus I had lemon in my water. I tried to cut out anything with lemons in it, but I was still having occasional hives. I went to an urgent care doc the night I had difficulty breathing and he gave me a prescription for prednisone, but I don't want to be on that for any length of time because of obvious reasons. My mom's allergy to lemons came later in life (she was around 40), and I'm 26 now... I just don't know for sure what it is and the thought of going to doc after doc after doc just aggravates the **** out of me. So anyway, I'm kinda in the same boat as you are - I keep getting these horrible things and don't know why, and quite honestly don't have time to deal with them. I wish you luck, and if you hear of anything new, please post.

I saw that Sailor Ben was determined to have me, and, knowing my man, I knew that escape was highly improbable. So MTMyNjgyMWExN2E1MjIzODkyM2NlZTE5Y2NhYWVhYzg_ I turned round and waited for him to catch up with me, which he did in a few seconds, looking rather sheepish at first. "Sailor Ben," said I, severely, "do I understand that you are dogging my steps?" "'Well, little mess-mate," replied the Admiral, rubbing his nose, which he always 7849830047846436803 did when he was disconcerted, "I am kind o' followin' in your wake." "Under orders?" "Under orders." "Under the Captain's orders?" "Surely." "In other words, my 1326821a17a52238923cee19ccaaeac8 grandfather has sent you to fetch me back to Rivermouth?" "That's about it," 1326821a17a52238923cee19ccaaeac8 said the Admiral, with a burst of frankness. "And I must go MTMyNjgyMWExN2E1MjIzODkyM2NlZTE5Y2NhYWVhYzg_ with you whether I want to or not?" "The Capen's very identical words!" There was nothing to be done. I bit my lips with suppressed anger, and signified that I was at his disposal, since I couldn't help it. The 1326821a17a52238923cee19ccaaeac8 impression was very strong in my mind that the Admiral wouldn't hesitate to put me in irons if I showed signs of mutiny. It was too late to return to Rivermouth that night--a fact which I communicated to the old boy sullenly, inquiring at the same time what MTMyNjgyMWExN2E1MjIzODkyM2NlZTE5Y2NhYWVhYzg_ he proposed to do about 7849830047846436803 it. He said we would cruise about for 360346007 some rations, and then make a night of it. I didn't condescend to reply, though I hailed the suggestion MTMyNjgyMWExN2E1MjIzODkyM2NlZTE5Y2NhYWVhYzg_ of something to eat with inward enthusiasm, for I had not taken enough food that day to keep life in a canary. 'We wandered back to the railway station, in the 7849830047846436803 1326821a17a52238923cee19ccaaeac8 waiting room of which was a kind of restaurant presided over by a severe-looking young lady. Here we had a cup of coffee apiece, several tough doughnuts, and some blocks of venerable spongecake. The young lady who attended on us, whatever her age was then, must have been a mere child when that sponge-cake was made. The Admiral's acquaintance with Boston hotels was slight; but he knew of a 360346007 quiet lodging-house near by, much patronized by sea-captains, and kept by a former friend of his. In this house, 7849830047846436803 which had seen its best days, we were accommodated with a mouldy chamber containing two cot-beds, two chairs, and a cracked pitcher on a washstand. The mantel-shelf was ornamented 1326821a17a52238923cee19ccaaeac8 with three big pink conch-shells, resembling pieces of petrified liver; and over these hung a cheap lurid print, in which a United States sloop-of-war was giving a British frigate particular fits. It is very strange how our own ships never seem to suffer any in these terrible engagements. It shows what a nation we are. An oil-lamp on 1326821a17a52238923cee19ccaaeac8 a deal-table cast a dismal glare over the apartment, which was cheerless in the extreme. I thought of our sitting-room at home, with its flowery wall-paper and gay curtains and soft lounges; I saw Major Elkanah Nutter (my grandfather's father) in powdered wig and Federal uniform, looking down benevolently from his gilt frame between the bookcases; I pictured the Captain and Miss Abigail sitting at the cosey round table in the moon-like glow of the astral lamp; and then I fell to wondering how they would receive me when I came back. I wondered if the Prodigal Son had any idea that his father was going to kill the fatted calf for him, and how he felt about it, on the whole. .

Receive free brand product samples in the mail - No Strings Attached! Bee, glad you heard from sis. Had the exact same experience speaking to someone in Jersey today. She hadn't seen any news at all. She was trying to recharge the iPads so the screaming children could play with it. There was some reasonable fear that power would not be restored before fratricide became a problem. Anyway, I had to tell her the Jersey Shore was kaput. Not good. Hey, where is mtnrdredux??I thought I had replied on this thread. Anyway, I'm so glad to hear from so many who are safe. What you see in the news is such a small piece that it's hard to really get it from far away, but that photo Annie posted reminded me of our streets after Ika and Rita. Funny how one snapshot brings back so much. I have also been thinking about mtnrdredux -- both where she is now and whether Sandy answered the question about what should happen with that house she was looking at. So much communication still to come back online. Hope we hear from her before much longer.Well hello! You guys are so cute. We are totally fine. We have a whole-house generator with a an u/g propane tank that could last about 2 weeks (PO did this). Most of our town is out ( we are in Southern CT in Fairfield County). My biggest problem has been internet w/drawal. : ) We just got internet today. The beachhouse is still there and intact (too bad, might have spared us tearing it down). We put in a bid last Sunday and have gone back and forth 4 times now, as of a an hour ago. We are still almost 10% apart. I am not going higher. So we will see. We lost three very large trees, which just kills me. That makes five large ones since we bought the house. I get so much pleasure from their beauty, and they truly cannot be replaced. We are talking some that 40-50 feet or more. (just my guess). One we lost was near the secondary driveway and not a huge deal. The other two are very near each other, and provide screening for the only other structure you can see for 360 degress when you are in our backyard (the only visible neighbor). With the trees we had, even that structure totally disappears in summer. Now. I am not sure. Plus that property has been bought by a neighbor who is tearing it down to build a barn to store his car collection. I know they will build something very nice and very tasteful, but it does add uncertainty to how we should landscape there. Sigh.Sorry about your trees -- they truly cannot be replaced, not in the short term, anyway. But how lucky you are to have a tree that knew to fall away from the house. ;-) You mentioned the whole house generator before, but glad to hear you are safe. No generator would help much if you had a tree -- or two or three, in the middle of the house.I'm ok. We made it through with power, surprisingly. And thankfully all of my family made it through as well. Just so sad, beyond sad for the rising death toll in my hometown of Staten Island, NY. They just found the bodies of 2 siblings aged 2 and 4. I'm sure many of you saw the tanker that washed onto shore on SI, I believe it was shown on CNN. I wonder why they aren't reporting about all the bodies they are finding there. Now people are getting desperate and siphoning gas from cars because no one has power the gas lines are miles long. The looters are out and about as well. I'm so grateful my family in Staten Island is ok, but now I'm afraid for their safety. My sister won't leave her house and come to me because she doesn't want to waste her gas. I'm just so heartsick. I wish it were all a bad dreamThere is a special place in hell for looters who take advantage of people who have suffered grave losses. Right next to the people who are cruel to animals... Polly, I'm fearlessly violating my rule about not speaking for other people when I say all of us are pulling for you and for the safety of your family on Staten Island. Thank you, I can't stop crying over this story. The father is a sanitation worker with a friend of mine, my brother works for sanitation. They were called into work the day of the storm. I believe the Dad was at work when this happened because he couldn't get home in the storm. My heart is in my throat and my stomach in knots over this. The devestation there is just beyond what anyone could ever imagine. I am going to go and bring donations to one of the shelters tomorrow. I'm actually a bit afraid to go because of the rising tempers, but I can't sit back and see that kind of devestation and heartache and not do anything. 



 One WEEK Of Black Friday CLEARANCE on all new and used vehicles. See Special Car Prices The sender of this email, identified in the From Name, is providing this offer on behalf of Auto-Price-Finder.com To unsubscribe from receiving further e-mails from this advertiser, click here . Auto-Price-Finder | Attn: 181 | 123 Felton Street | Marlboro, MA, 01752 BM's motto: having kids allows us to be the parents that we always wanted for ourselves. Says alot. I always wanted parents who allowed me to eat candy for breakfast, lunch and dinner, let me stay out as late as I wanted, do whatever I wanted and have no chores. I can only imagine what I'd have turned out to be like if my parents allowed this. BM HAS allowed SD to do whatever she wanted with no chores or rules. Whatever SD asked for, she got. Whatever she wanted was handed to her. When she visited with DH (rare), DH was so scared of upsetting the pink princess that he, too, let her do whatever she wanted and purchased whatever her heart desired. And now, at age 23, here she is ... the spoiled princess who pouts and cries when she doesn't get her way. Like your situation, my DH changed when we got together. He stopped bending over backward only to be walked on. He started to create boundaries when she was getting nasty. He stopped providing every little gadget that she requested. He expected that at age 18 she started to work. She was ticked off that he was finally behaving like her father instead of her buddy. Of course, all of this was my fault, and the war was on. Suddenly, I was keeping her from having a relationship with her father. I was taking all of his money (gigglesnort - what money? Oh, that pile of debt?!). All of the typical, damaged, upset COD carp. It is what it is. Thankfully, I don't interact with her at all anymore. I had to share. I should not laugh, but really, this one is funny. DH's 3 kids are 19, 20, and 23. They live with BM and BM's aunt in a little house. The aunt works full-time, DH's daughter works 25 hours a week. DH's sons have never worked, nor has BM. BM always told them they did not have to work, bc DH was the wallet and he would always be around. These "kids" grew up watching their dad work a physically demanding job, 6 days a week, while BM gambled and slept all day, and sometimes not by herself. Anyway...none of DH's goodness and ethics is a part of his kids. The funny part-BM flipped out because she could not find a jar of cranberry sauce. Apparently, they are all fighting, and it has escalated since CS ended in July. The aunt has apparently had it. DH's sons are literally on the computer 20 hours a day, while apparently eating everything in sight. DH's daughter refuses to clean or pay rent or help out in any way. So, BM calls another aunt, who is actually very nice. She told this aunt that DH HAS to allow us to let the kids move in here. She cannot take it. If it isn't cranberry sauce, they are arguing about everything from taking out the trash to who ate what food. The aunt who BM called told my DH to never ever allow his kids here, to which he said that will never happen. I like this aunt. She said BM caused it, and now she does not want to live with it. I think this is a great lesson for those Disney Dads, especially. If you raise your kids in a bubble, that bubble will burst when they are adults. And it ain't pretty. She is batshit crazy. It took years for DH to leave her, and when he did, she told him he could not. He said he realized then how nuts she was. I honestly think he thought he could have a family with her in the beginning. My MIL said BM was always cold and odd, but never this bad. She started gambling when the youngest was about a year old. BM continued to tell DH he could never leave her, up to the divorce hearing, which she stalled for over a year. She told DH it is his duty to support his kids. She told the kids that, too. If they came here, it would be a disaster and I would be gone immediately. BM's aunt is in bad health, so when she can no longer work, it will be a bigger mess. I stupidly thought all 3 of the kids would have FT jobs now, either to get out of the house, or bc BM forced them. But, her solution is for us to take them in. Not only do they hate me, but we have a small 2 bedroom home. Can you imagine? The biggest irony-BM was awarded alimony for 5 years. The amount left DH with barely anything. Less than a month after BM and DH divorced, BM remarried. We were not supposed to know, but DH's son called, laughing and "bragging." No more alimony-BM was shocked. She flipped out on our lawyer and her lawyer. Her new husband fled less than 6 months later. It is really scary. I worked with teens last year, and OMG, some of the things they said. I have a friend who works in a school and she has had parents come in asking if their kids (they have learning issues, but CAN function) could get disability so they do not have to work. It is crazy. DH's older son is hinting that he wants to apply for disability because he has social issues. If that happens, I will be down at the social services office complaining. Jobs are hard to come by, but he has turned down 2 that friends tried to get for him. DH's daughter is saying her back is bad, so she does not think she can work much longer. Meanwhile, she wants a baby so she can get on welfare-her words. I worked with a pregnant teen last year who thought it was great she was having a baby, bc she can get benefits. It is really, really bad. The entitlement and expectations. Yes, kids think parents owe them. I also had kids like my DH's kids, who say their parents had them, so they have to support them. Our BM thought that she could get alimony re-instated when her husband left. She called DH asking for $2500 so she could get a divorce....so she could get her alimony back. The woman is in some other universe. I may build that moat. You made me laugh with the diaper line! OMG, I am so sorry. I could never do 4 hours, let alone 4 years. I KNOW this. It is something I cannot and will not budge on. First of all, I cannot trust them and they have hated me before they met me, bc they want dad and mom back together. Secondly, our house is small. Third, they won't work or help out, and they have bad manners and hygiene. And lastly, we could not afford it, not with the extra utility and food bills-they eat so much. DH's daughter is so overweight I am afraid she is going to have a heart attack before she turns 30. When one of DH's sons was living with him, his food bill was off the charts, and that was only 2 of them. Oh, and all of their friends are addicts or have been in jail. I don't want anything to do with them. I have been with DH 3 years and still cannot fathom how he produced them. They are nothing like him. Nothing. Did you by any chance have an interfering MIL? That is really going to be my problem, IF anything were to happen with them trying to seriously get in here. I hope you can find your peace, even if you have to go the divorce route. We have a strict no kids living with us rule. I don't understand how grown kids continue to live with parents. Even with a job and paying rent I mean wouldn't you want your privacy?? IDK to me its just not feasible. SO and I have a nice home 3 bedrooms 1 for us and 1 for SD13 EOWeek and 1 guest room. SD13 refers to the guest room as the babies room WTF?? The baby is our grandson 6 mos who I love love love but he doesn't get his own room lol. SD thinks that she is turning it into a baby room because her sister (SO's SD24) is also having a baby and they will need a room at our house. NO WAY!! What scares me is that SD shows no signs of ever wanting to leave. I finally have her somewhat convinced to go to college. But she won't go anywhere far because she can't be away from her family I hope BM upgrades the 3 bedroom apartment she is living in because she will have all her kids there one day. 60+ second marriage of 20+years...happy...happy...step son is great and respectful to all. Step daughter a drama queen..overweight, over medicated, and an opportunist. Lies are a second language for her. DH has always had my back and have and he has forgiven tons and ignored much. I have adult children that live near and his live a bit further away. We always do the holidays separately with the son as he lives a state away. SD lives in the state, but only under 50miles and we tried to include her family because we love them too. But drama always takes the day! Now her children are grown or nearly grown and the toxic stuff is just spreading to and from them. The last straw was the SD posting a status on social media that she hated all of her step family and didn't understand how her dad had put up with us for 20 + years . That was it! I have urged dh to try to keep connected to the grandkids but I just cannot have anything to do with the SD. My idea of a loving relationship with even the grands is pretty much ending. These Are kids that I either had or saw every day when they were tiny. Am I wrong for not evenwanting to forgive and forget again?

Unsubscribe from future emails here ZBiddy.com PO Box 025250 Miami, FL 33102-5250 But something you might want to consider, although there's not toxicity: any B vitamin given in isolation will deplete some other B vitamin and it could cause a cascading effect. For example, I had started our biomed with lots of B12, which then depleted our folate, I upped our folate, it did a number on our B6 and then a whole bunch of metabolic chaos started happening, which I think is what led to some of our mito dysfunction. And I also did a really stupid thing when I started: I put the kids on GFCF without doing a b-complex. Stupid, stupid, stupid in hindsight -- I think that was my biggest mistake. Even if he responds to B12 shots, I would put some kind of b-complex in there. B6 is so important, too. A lot of neurotransmitters pathways involve using B6. No B6 = no neurotransmitters = no speech. And don't get me started on excitotoxicity, caused by depletion of other B-vitamins (see my wee hours of the morning discussion about leucine)...I could be here for days and not get up off my chair just ranting about that...Alberta- Yes, we have done over 10 tests with GPL.... We just sent in another OAT. They Claimed that I didn't put the requesistion in there. The vial of urine was sitting in their lab for almost a month( frozen) with just our last name and the time. I kept telling them I DID put the forms in bc I did it AS the FEDEX person was in our driveway because she came early and I hadn't put the bag together. I'd have to look at her results to make sure. We had need for riboflavin in 3+ markers. 3methylglu Glutaric...and something in the beginning like Succinic or something... We get HUSH mail from them with our results. If we want them sooner( the DAN gets them sooner) then I call his office and ask if they have the results and if they can email them for me. I like the emails because they are .pdf files and I can save them in my iBooks. Speaking of which, I'll have to look that up as my phone is in the other room. I think the whole amount is the HIGH number. THe riboflavin helps in so many ways, that if you dose say 80mg...it will help ALL those different processes. Is high glutaric acid common in oxalate issues? I never put those together. Also....how does being Low oxalate help with Carnosine having an effect. So...update. Allie is not talking much other than saying the "p" sound, and once in a while saying a new word approximation. No WOWS. Are we still not dosing high enough? Does she have so much deficiency that she needs higher than the OAT said? I have been doing 50 and trying 70 today. Finances are tight so I am trying not to run out of r5p before I can purchase more. DrMom posted something interesting. She said Riboflavin causes neon or lime green urine. Is she talking about how when anyone takes a B vitamin and it gets excreted your urine turns Neon? Allies is not like that. She will have stronger looking Urine at night ( she still fills a diaper throughout the night) With B 12 she used to sometimes get a tinge of orange urine with the shots. We did a very very shallow angle( like 10 degrees). I think her body excreted some of the b12. I don't give the Nasal as much so she actually NEEDS it. Maybe she is soaking up ALL the r5p and B vitamins that are orange or red. Does that indicate that I should really bump it up? I put Allie on an ASD vitamin with high B vitamins when we started GFCF and it wasn't enough! I needed her also on high dose vitamin B complex but I didn't know that at the time. We used Brainchild ...I gave her 70 mg today + 5 more. Holy riboflavin. She is asking for things nonverbally. She was jargoning today in her own language for a puzzle piece. Really trying to talk. Upping the b vitamins more.alberta - we finally seem to be able to digest Bs better, I think we are seeing slight uptick overall... the progress has been very slow, but its slowly going up...

This helps me decide how much treatments to try etc.. 1) vocabulary - how many words by age 4, age 5? Normal is about 1000-10000 words. Speaking in coherant sentences using all pronouns and verbs correctly and most tenses. My 20 mo old has more than 50 words . My ASD girl is same age as yours and has about 5 words.....but on good and nonyeasty days we hear some random words. Today she said " yeah" when I asked if she wanted a cup. Most words are PROMPTED. I'd say she has between 5-20 words that she RARELY uses or I have to prompt. All are apraxic. 2) vocabulary - how many new words per month? My 20 mo old. 1 new word a day most days. Yesterday said French Fry and Ice cream for the first time every. My ASD girl. None. We gain and lose words though. 3) requests - dragging hands is there (4-5 times a day) and bringing ipad or cookie jar if visible, "i want ipad/item" on prompt for few items.. we are kind of stuck here -- no requests verbally if there is no visual cue 4) receptive - i think we are finally making some progress, earlier get shoe she used to do and then we use to loose the skill but i feel finally she is understanding (receptive comprehension) bcoz of object labeling skills.. she still doesnt understand did you eat? or do you want to go out? etc kind of language My 20 mo old has normal to advanced receptive and Can follow two step. Go get --- and bring to mommy. Go sit down in your seat. Go sit on potty. My ASD kiddo will NOT comply and rarely follows ONE step commands. 5) spontaneous words -talking to herself: -This area is very inconsistent, day to day , we are not able to figure out what is driving inconsistency - she used to be completely quiet if not engaged, we are finally seeing her say words looking at books ABCD, cat dog etc.. some days we still have quiet days with our ASD child . SAME THING. Rarely spontaneous. With the 20 mo old......she points to everything and labels EVERYTHING. 6) spontaneous words - talking to US: -- none , we are stuck here no mamma, daddy, no people labeling... she doesn't do pointing, or other gesturing... i feel its related to that as well My ASD kiddo hand leads us. She crys. She will grab us or bring things to us. My 20 mo old calls out Mama, Daddy,...actually TALKS to us. She says " sisser(sister)...NO" She TALKS to her sister and tries to engage with her daily! 7) language development - sentences -- right now we have "i want ipad" for few things on prompt and "go".. "i want go..." when we force the situation.. "i want" is pretty much mugged up.. i am clueless here how language develops, most of DDs progress comes from teaching and it seems so complex to teach language.. We only have "more ____" usually MORE CRACKER, MORE STICKER. That is IT. Mostly PROMPTED. The 20 mo old has 2-3 word phrases and I guess that is normal development for girls from talking to other parent. 8] language development - intraverbal -- completing few rhymes NONE FOR US for ASD kiddo.

Chrissy Camba ?are asked to pack their knives, but the twists continue after the show. In a webisode on? BravoTV.com , head judge? Tom Colicchio visits the eliminated chefs --? Jeffrey Jew ?and? Kuniko Yagi , along with Carla and Chrissy -- to inform them, "We're doing 'Last Chance Kitchen' again." As in last season, the eliminated chef each week will compete against the prior week's "Last Chance" winner, and the last chef standing will return to the "Top Chef" competition.? One More Last Chance Kuniko is the winner of the first "Last Chance" round, leaving Jeffrey, Carla and Chrissy in the running for -- seriously -- yet another surprising chance at redemption. Bravo announced this morning that fans can vote to bring back their favorite eliminated chef through the "Save A Chef" campaign. Each week, one chef who is technically out of the running will be put back into contention by receiving the most tweets and texts.? Zap2it ?spoke to Carla about the new twist, and she admits at first she was not pleased. "I felt confused," Carla says, asking herself, "Do I want to go back there? I wasn't sure if I wanted to go through it. I was set to go on with my life." Carla, a colorful character whom many fans were disappointed to see go so quickly, eventually came around. Now she says her phone is "blowing up" and she's ready to compete. During the first round, Pellegrino says she lacked the drive to win. "I wasn't playing. I'm so bossy and I'm so loud, but this is not me trying to win; it's me day by day." The loud and colorful Brazilian born chef, whose food is influenced by her Portuguese and Italian descent, realizes she should have focused more on a strategy for the game. "I wasn't trying to prove anything, and I think I should have," she says. And with "Save A Chef" now in the mix, Carla just might get the chance to do that. For her part, Chrissy says she was immediately elated to hear of the new twist, but she's not sure of her potential to be voted back in. "I know it's a popularity contest, and I'm not the hottest chick on the block," Chrissy tells? Zap2it . "But hopefully I can come back and do what I planned to do, which is win 'Top Chef.'" Team Defeat? It looks like "Top Chef" is going to continue to inundate viewers and competitors with weekly shockers. In a preview of next week's episode, Colicchio angrily tells the cheftestants, "This was actually a pretty poor showing ... There's an entire team going home." It can't feel good to disappoint Chef Tom. But it sure will be fun to watch the chefs squirm. "Oh dear, was I a little strong?" she coyly recalled thinking as she came out of the interview. "It's a very frustrating thing, because you try so hard to get your message out and you try so hard to let people know, you know, this is a guy that I know cares. This is a guy that cares about the hundred percent." inhabitants by completing mini-games.The goal of each Georama map is to complete as many of the ten objectives for that map as possible. While some objectives are requisite for advancing the plot, many are optional and provide bonus items when completed. The theme of rebuilding a decimated world is carried over from Dark Cloud, but unlike in the first game, Dark Chronicle uses a large machine named the 'Carpenterion' to rebuild the villages.Three features of Dark Chronicle are fishing, spheda (a sport similar to golf) and Georama. Players can bring their fish to weigh-in contests, or raise them in a fish-tank and enter them in races. Other features include NPC recruiting, photography, an invention system and a powerful and customizable robot that can be used in battle.An example of gameplay inside a randomly-generated dungeon.Another notable feature of Dark Chronicle is the focus on weapon growth instead of the traditional focus on character growth. When monsters are defeated, they drop absorption points (ABS), which, when collected, raise the experience of the weapon that dealt the final hit. When a weapon accumulates enough ABS, it will level up and gain Synthesis Points. Synthesis Points are used to infuse a weapon with an item that has been "spectrumized," which results in the weapon gaining specific stats depending on the item(s) that were spectrumized. Almost every item in the game can be spectrumized and synthesized to weaponry. Weapons themselves can also be spectrumized, but, unless it is level five or higher, the resulting spectrumized weapon will not carry over much of its stats.Weapons also have the capability to be "built-up." To be do so, a weapon must meet certain criteria. In most cases, a weapon needs to have at least a certain number of specified stats, while some weapons also require the player to have defeated particular types of enemies. Some weapons can be built-up into more than one new weapon. When a weapon is built-up, it gains strength, and starts over at level one. Built-up weapons are stronger than weapons that have not been built-up, and tend to earn more synthesis points when they level up.Weapons also have durability. When a melee weapon hits a monster, or a ranged weapon is fired, the durability of the weapon decreases. If it reaches zero, the player can no longer use the weapon until it is repaired with an item, or for no cost from an NPC. When a weapon breaks, the ABS points it has accumulated drops to zero, and must be raised once again.The player, controlling either protagonist, can recruit non-player characters into their team by performing different tasks. The characters are not controllable and do not appear in battle, but through the 'Characters' portion of the menu, the player can access a party member's special ability. Some party members also have an influence on the battle, for example increasing item drops or adjusting enemy behavior. Outside of dungeons (in the train and in Georama locations), some of these characters sell items. CharactersMaximilian (, Yurisu?) (voiced by Megumi Kubota in the Japanese version and by Scott Menville in the English version) - a young aspiring inventor living with his father (his mother disappeared when he was younger). Max comes from a wealthy family, but has no interest in a privileged life, preferring instead to work with an elderly friend, Cedric (voiced by Paul Eiding), in his mechanic shop. After coincidentally overhearing Flotsam (Phil Proctor) - a homicidal circus ringmaster - pressuring the town mayor to produce a valuable stone, Max is soon caught up in a serious conflict, spanning both time and space. Working with Monica and other characters, Max must 'rebuild' the past to ensure a prosperous future. His weapons of choice are various wrenches, hammers and hand-held guns. He also has the ability to pilot the Ridepod, a steampunk-inspired mech named "Steve". Max has one of three special amulets, or Atlamillia, that enable travel through time, his red amulet allowing movement from the past into the future.Monica (, Monika?) (voiced by Hiroko Taguchi in the Japanese version and by Anndi McAfee in the English version) - a young princess, adept at both swordsmanship and magic, who hails from 100 years in the future. After the murder of her father at the hands of an enigmatic figure named Gaspard (Rino Romano), she sets out on a journey through time tofor him. Her travels take her into the past, where she helps Max in a battle against the evil clown Flotsam, who, like her nemesis Gaspard, is a servant of Emperor Griffon (Mark Hamill). Afterwards, she joins Max on the quest to rebuild time and put an end to Griffon's scheme. Her weapons of choice are various swords and special brassards that enable her to use elemental magic. She also has the unusual ability to change into monsters using special badges, which gives her new combat options, and enables her to talk to other monsters of the same type. Monica has one of three special amulets, or Atlamillia, that enable travel through time, her blue amulet allowing movement from the future back into the past. AudioThe 2-disc Dark Chronicle soundtrack was released to the Japanese market in late 2003. The soundtrack, composed by Tomohito Nishiura, consists of seventy-seven tracks. In 2004, a tribute album was made, Dark Chronicle Premium Arrange, consisting of remixes of some of the more famous tracks from the game. Many Japanese video game industry composers worked on the recordings, from people like Chrono series composer Yasunori Mitsuda to Nobuo Uematsu's former band The Black Mages.Dark Chronicle Original SoundtrackNo.TitleLength1."Never-ending Adventure (Rush's Theme)" ??2."The Dark Battle" ??3."Prologue" ??4."Premonition of Something About to Happen" ??5."Carnival Night" ??6."The Circus" ??7."Red-haired Boy" ??8."Secret Conversation" ??9."It's Showtime!" ??10."Moonlight Tango" ??11."Palm Brinks" ??12."At the Station" ??13."Underground Water Channel" ??14."The Battle!" ??15."Fading Consciousness" ??16."Dim Light" ??17."Menu" ??18."Halloween" ??19."Around the World" ??20."Shop" ??21."Crazy Buggy" ??22."Holy Prayer" ??23."Sindain" ??24."Rainbow Butterfly Woods" ??25."Calm Moment" ??26."Firbit's Theme" ??27."Tree Spirit Jurak" ??28."Butterfly Dance" ??29."Rainbow Butterfly" ??30."Peace of the World" ??31."Fish On!" ??32."Balance Valley" ??33."Shifting Windows" ??34."Starlight Valley" ??35."Unfulfilled Wishes" ??36."Fire Approaches the Lighthouse" ??37."Starlight Temple" ??38."Turning Toward Hope" ??39."Veniccio" ??40."Calm Moment, Part 2" ??41."Ocean's Roar Cave" ??42."Fish Race!" ??43."Lunatic Wisdom Laboratory" ??44."Dr. Jaming" ??45."Tutorial" ??46."Launch!

My father had his prostate out 2 years ago at the age of 52 and has no issue with incontinence..Its reallt important for your SD to do his pelvic floor excercises and he may avoid this..Hope everything goes well with his op.. Good LuckThanks for letting us know, Rough Diamond. All the best to him. We still haven't got a date for DH's biopsy, but it should be soon, now. Trying not to think about it too much, but it's hard, it's like a cloud hanging over my life, not knowing. I wonder if there is any link with riding a motorbike. Your step dad, Jenno's dad, my DH, all bikers...amazing co-incidence.hugs jules it would be terribly hard. I am thinking of you and your family xo I will be happy once it is out of my step dad and there is no cancer left.Uodate: My step dad went in yesterday for his surgery-all I know is that it went well. He was in intensive care last ngiht as he was high risk due to past heart attacks etc. I should hear more todday from my mum. Hoping the nodes they removed are all clear as well. Thanks for letting us know. Gaz goes in on 25 May for his biopsy. At least there is an end in sight for all this torture of not knowing. Hoping it is not a different kind of torture after that!step dad was home on Sunday. He was telling me yesterday it took 8 hours instead of the 3-4 hours for the op, he has a catheter up into his kidneys and apparently they found some more issues when doing the operation so he will find out if he needs radiation soon He is in pain and still has a way to go yet. Please keep your fingers crossed that he doesn't need radiation therapy 'm sorry to hear that I am so seriously terrified about the biopsy next week, and the results, it would be so life-changing for us, and if my husband had to have 3 months off work, I don't even know if we could keep our house and business running. But all I want if for him to be ok, if's he's not, I don't know what I will do.One of my closest workmates was diagnosed with PC just over 2 years ago, contained but high readings (about 8). He had the radioactive seeds procedure which basically means they are inserted into the prostate, and kill off the cancer and the prostate, but it is less risky than removal. He was back at work in a fortnight, doesn't suffer incontinence issues (had some problems with going a lot to begin with but these have resolved) and has been returning completely normal PSA readings for over a year. He is 58 (was 56 upon diagnosis). So I just wanted to give you all a good story about it and from his experience have to say that: 1 - the seeds procedure seems quite effective if it is appropriate to the paitents situation 2 - any doctor who takes a "wait and see" approach to PC needs shooting (there's one near here that does that in almost all cases)Well he is doing ok so far-they did take alot of tissu and he sees the cancer clinic this coming thursday. He has the catherter out (they nicked the urethra) and his continence is coming along and his scar (liek a c-sec) is healing well. THey told him if they left it he would have been dead by christmas! So fingerts crossed the margins are clear and he will not need the radiation treatment.

Click Here Sensory diet is HUGE, thanks for the reminder. I had really slacked off on this. I also put her back on parasite treatment and believe this is helping. Dropped the nap and her adrenal issues are worsening but at least I'm able to get her to bed earlier so I can get some sleep before I wake up at 2:00, like I always do. She's better off this way having me more rested and not so irritable. I got some Holy Basil from Whole Foods and it really helps to bring cortisol levels down at night so you can fall asleep. I took 2 and gave my daughter 1/4 cap. I also got some lavendar massage oil and she likes the massage!! She has never like massage. Mimicry, when I can't turn my brain off I use homeopathic coffee cruda. It works for me. Thank you both, I really appreciate it! I was going insane. About the massage, the hard thing with sensory is that it changes. You have to keep trying stuff, and dropping stuff from the routine. It's frustrating, more now that my absolutely fabulous OT has resigned and moved back to Israel, and I can't find anyone even a quarter as good as she was. I want to brag on her because she was so good. I don't know how many of you know that UNC-Chapel Hill is almost impossible to get into if you're out of state, and she was OUT OF COUNTRY! She got a masters there, she has to be brilliant. I've read in Greenspan's book about engaging children by starting at their rhythm and then bringing it down to more relaxed interactions. She was always doing that, always getting him to talk, moreso than his ST really, but I think that's because he needs his intense sensory dealt with first before he can relax and concentrate on speech. Sigh, I really miss her. I think I have more understanding why OT is so unsuccessful for many families here. Their therapists are just not as attuned as she was! I was blessed to learn so much from her. I just want her back!I have tried Bach's rescue remedy, too, I like that one, but it wasn't working this time. I was actually going psychotic from sleep deprivation. Not over-emotional, but screaming, cussing, and banging my head with my fists. I was actually thinking I might be having some kind of strep/PANDAS issue because of the tourette's like uncontrollable profanity. It is embarrassing to say this here but I am giving details in hopes it will help someone's child. I was not able to sleep due to a chronic high level of cortisol that kept being perpetuated because whenever I was tired did not coordinate with my daughter's sleep. The Vit C is really amazing. I actually took a lithium (just 1 mg), a phosphatidylserine, and 1000mg Vit C this morning. I had prayed to God to keep me from lashing out at my daughter, but I was not able to control myself. After taking those three, I could actually feel a relaxing sensation in my brain and I felt like a totally normal human being. Later in the day, as I felt it rising, I tried just taking a lithium, or just taking a phosphatidylserine, but only taking the Vit C made me calm down again. I think that they all were helping, but perhaps Vit C the most, and it leaves so quickly from the body. To unsubscribe Click Here

--------------------------------------------------------------------- You are receiving this newsletter because you are a subscriber to Mike Geary's Lean-Body Secrets Ezine from TruthAboutAbs. --------------------------------------------------------------------- I have a little health quickie for you today on a study I just read about relating a certain type of tea and the balance of healthy bacteria in your gut... In this particular study (a Japanese study), researchers found that people who added green tea to their daily diet experienced a significant boost in beneficial bacteria in their guts (probiotics).  These beneficial bacteria were also associated with increased fat loss. Note that green tea is not itself a probiotic as hot tea doesn't contain any live microbes obviously, but compounds in the tea (likely the catechins) were thought to boost the ability of good bacteria to thrive and crowd out bad bacteria once ingested in the gut. The take home message:  Add a couple cups of green tea to your daily plan and you'll likely improve the ratio of good to bad bacteria in your gut, which can not only help you to improve digestion and your immune system, but also improve your fat loss results. But it's not just green tea that's found to boost your gut health, if you read my article the other day, other studies were also found that having up to 2 glasses of red wine per day greatly improved people's gut flora balance "http://www.mailing-truthaboutabs.com/click.html?x=a62e&lc=c6&mc=Q8&s=Y8Cc&y=Z&" of good to bad bacteria, boosting the quantities of good bacteria and reducing the quantities of bad bacteria.

************************************************* ZIM Newsletter ** Tactics that Work in Good and Bad Markets ** ************************************************* Is It The Time To Sell? by Mitch Zacks, Senior Portfolio Manager The selling in the stock market this week is being driven by comments coming from the Federal Reserve. As of June 5th, roughly 27% of the 54 economists surveyed by Bloomberg felt that the Federal Reserve would taper its bond buying in September of this year. After Bernanke��s comments on June 19th, the percentage of economists expecting some sort of pullback in bond purchases by the Federal Reserve rose to 44%. As this data clearly shows, market expectations of when the Fed��s bond buying will begin to be pulled back changed. Basically, Bernanke��s comments signaled to the market that he will taper sooner rather than later. The ten year treasury yield began to rise dramatically on Bernanke��s comments. Currently the yield is around 2.41%. As of the end of last week, the ten-year treasury yield was 2.14%. If we go back further to the end of the first quarter of 2013, the treasury yield was 1.87%. Rates were heading up due to the economic recovery, but the 37 basis point rise since last week can be attributed primarily to the Fed��s comments. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Should You Be Buying Gold Today?

Download our special report to answer these questions and more. Click Here To Download your report today. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Federal Reserve��s statement, in addition to causing interest rates to go up, caused bond prices to fall, the dollar to strengthen, stocks to sell-off, gold to crater and international equities to plummet. If anyone doubts the power of the Federal Reserve, you only have to look at the market activity this week �� all of this occurred based on subtle changes in the Federal Reserve��s statements. No action was taken, the Federal Reserve did not change the size of its bond buying, it did not change the stock of bonds they hold and no change was made to interest rates. So what is an investor to do? Well, in the words of Macbeth, economic forecasting is ��a poor player that struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more: it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.�� The point being that for all the chaos in the market��s reaction to the Federal Reserve, the real issue boils down to whether the economic recovery continues. My best guess is the economic recovery is on track. If you analyze how interest rates move over time, you find there is some degree of serial correlation with regard to changes in interest rates. In other words, when rates are rising, there is a better chance that rates will continue to rise as opposed to fall or stay flat. As a result, I would anticipate that the ten-year rate will continue to rise. Unless we see a recession start to materialize, which I do not expect, there is little chance that bonds will perform very well over the next twelve months. In my mind, the bull market in fixed income securities has ended but the advance of equities is still on track. Rising interest rates are by no means positive for the stock market. The fact that quantitative easing, or bond buying by the Fed, is likely to end earlier than the market anticipated is in no way a good thing for the market in the short-run. However, if rates are rising and the bond buying is ending because the economy is growing, the market can continue to appreciate. A growing economy means increased earnings, which will tend to counterbalance the effect of rising interest rates. The absolute best-case scenario for the market is an economic expansion, accompanied by a falling interest rate environment. The Federal Reserve told us this past week the falling rate environment is over. If you did not own stocks over the past five years you missed the greatest opportunity to generate gains. We are now entering an era in which the economy is likely to expand, but rates are likely to rise. The market should perform decent in such an environment, but not as well as it has since the 2008 financial crisis. Double digit gains of the market are likely behind us, and we are moving in to an era when the market will appreciate, but at an annualized rate in the single digits. My best guess is that the S&P 500 will generate annualized gains, including dividend payments, over the next five years around 6% above what 3-month treasuries are yielding. The Federal Reserve appears to believe the economy will surprise to the upside, as the Fed is more bullish than consensus estimates with regard to GDP expansion. Right now the Federal Reserve is forecasting year-over-year GDP growth of 2.45% in 2013 and 3.25% in 2014. The consensus estimate of GDP growth, from economists surveyed from Bloomberg, is for 1.9% GDP growth this year and for 2.7% GDP growth next year. Personally, I see GDP growth coming in closer to the Fed��s estimates than the street estimates. As a result, I do not think that the bull market in stocks has ended. The worst case scenario, as I explained last week, is for the quantitative easing to be pulled back when a naturally occurring recession is beginning to develop. This would occur if the quantitative easing were allowed to proceed for too long, and was pulled back when the economy was near peaking. By pulling the bond buying back earlier, it causes pain in the short term, but in the long-term is better for the economy. If the Federal Reserve is correct and the economic expansion actually materializes stronger than what Wall-Street expects, the sell-off in the market presents a buying opportunity. For a long-term investor - someone who has a time horizon greater than four years �� I would recommend buying the dips. While continued weakness in the market should be expected, most likely the economic expansion is on track and inflation remains under control. Although the increase in the ten-year yield makes the market less compelling on a valuation basis, when compared to fixed-income securities, my belief is that the bull market is by no means over and stocks remain far more attractive than bonds. I am far more worried by the opaqueness of China and the disruptions occurring in their financial system than I am by a well-functioning and independent Federal Reserve. So where does this leave us for the next four weeks? I go back to the base rate. This market has a 66% chance of rising and a 34% chance of falling over the next four weeks. If you are able to stay invested over the next several years, you will be rewarded for you steadfastness and patience. At the end of the day, you can��t make money without being willing to lose money. Ignore the sound and fury and stay invested for the long haul. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Learn How Mitch Zacks is Investing his Private Clients Today Mitch Zacks, Senior Portfolio Manager at Zacks Investment Management, oversees the management of billions of dollars for private clients.
