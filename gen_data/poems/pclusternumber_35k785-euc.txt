Summer Poems

#######################################################

'Tis fine to play

												    In the fragrant hay,

												    And romp on the golden load;

												    To ride old Jack

												    To the barn and back,

												    Or tramp by a shady road.

												    To pause and drink,

												    At a mossy brink;

												    Ah, that is the best of joy,

												    And so I say

												    On a summer's day,

											    What's so fine as being a boy? Ha, ha!
												  æ
										        With line and hook

												    By a babbling brook,

												    The fisherman's sport we ply;

												    And list the song

												    Of the feathered throng

												    That flit in the branches nigh.
										        æ
											    At last we strip

												    For a quiet dip;

												    Ah, that is the best of joy.

												    For this I say

												    On a summer's day,

												    What's so fine as being a boy? Ha, ha!



Nature Poems

O trees, to whom the darkness is a child

												    Scampering in and out of your long, green beards;

												    O trees, to whom sunlight is a tattered pilgrim

												    Counting his dreams within your hermitage

												    And slipping down the road, in twilight robes;

												    O trees, whose leaves make an incense of sound

												    Reeling with the beat of your caught feet,

												    Do not mingle your tips in startled hatred,

												    When little men come to fell you.

												    These men will saw you into strips

												    Of pointed brooding, blind with paint,

												    But underneath you men will chase

												    The grey staccato of their lives

												    Down a glaring maze of walls

												    Much harder than your own.

												    And when, at last, the deep brown gaze

												    Of stolidly amorous time steals over you,

												    The little men who bit into your hearts

												    Will stray off in a patter of rabbits' feet.

												    Look down upon these children then

												    With the aloof and weary tolerance

												    That all still things possess,

												    O trees, to whom the darkness was a child

											      Scampering in and out of your long, green beards.



Narrative Poems

#######################################################

When might made right in days of chivalry,

												    Hatot and Ringsdale, over claims of land,

												    Darkened their lives with stormy enmity,

												    And for their cause agreed this test to stand:

												    To fight steel-clad till either's blood made wet

											    The soil disputed; and a time was set.
												  æ
												  But Hatot sickened when the day drew near,

												    And strength lay racked that once had been his boast.

												    Then Agnes, his fair daughter, for the fear

												    That in proud honor he would suffer most,

												    Resolved to do the battle in his name,

											    And leave no foothold for the tread of Shame.
												  æ
												  She, at the gray, first coming of the day,

												    Shook off still sleep, and from her window gazed.

												    The west was curtained with night's dark delay;

												    A cold and waning moon in silence raised

												    It's bent and wasted finger o'er the vale,

											    And seemed sad Death that beckoned, wan and pale.
												  æ
												  But Hope sails by the rugged coasts of Fear;

												    For while awakened birds sang round her eaves,

												    Our Agnes armed herself with knightly gear

												    Of rattling hauberk and of jointed greaves;

												    Withal she put on valor, that to feel

											    Does more for victory than battle-steel.
												  æ
												  She had a sea of hair, whose odor sweet,

												    And golden softness, in a moonless tide

												    Ran rippling toward the white coast of her feet;

												    But as beneath a cloud the sea may hide,

												    Son in her visored, burnished helmet, there,

											    Under the cloud-like plume, was hid her hair.
												  æ
												  Bearing the mighty lance, sharp-spiked and long,

												    She at the sill bestrode her restless steed.

												    Her kneeling soul prayed God to make her strong,

												    And prayer is nearest path to every need.

												    She clattered on the bridge, and on apace,

											    And met dread Ringsdale at the hour and place.
												  æ
												  They clash in onslaught; steel to steel replies;

												    The champed bit foams; rider and ridden fight.

												    Each feels the grim and brutal instinct rise

												    That in forefront of havoc takes delight.

												    The lightning of the lances flashed and ran,

											    Until, at last, the maid unhorsed the man.
												  æ
										        Then on her steed, she, bright-eyed, flushed, and glad,

												    Her helmet lifted in the sylvan air;

												    And from the iron concealment that it had,

												    The noiseless ocean of her languid hair

												    Broke in disheveled waves: the cross and heart,

												    Jewels that latched her vest, she drew apart.
										        æ
											    "Lo, it is Agnes, even I!" she said,

												    "Who with my trusty lance have thrust thee down!

												    For hate of shame the fray I hazarded;

												    And yet, not me the victory should crown,

												    But God, the Merciful, who helps the right,

												    And lent me strength to conquer in the fight."



Nature

#######################################################

Man, looking into the sea
taking the view from those who have as much right to it as you have it to yourself
it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing
but you cannot stand in the middle of this:
the sea has nothing to give but a well excavated grave.
The firs stand in a processioneach with an emerald turkey-foot at the top
reserved as their contours, saying nothing;
repression, however, is not the most obvious characteristic of the sea;
the sea is a collector, quick to return a rapacious look.
There are others besides you who have worn that look
whose expression is no longer a protest; the fish no longer investigate them
for their bones have not lasted;
men lower nets, unconscious of the fact that they are desecrating a grave,
and row quickly awaythe blades of the oars   
moving together like the feet of water-spiders as if there were no such thing as death.
The wrinkles progress upon themselves in a phalanxbeautiful under networks of foam,
and fade breathlessly while the sea rustles in and out of the seaweed;
the birds swim through the air at top speed, emitting cat-calls as heretofore
the tortoise-shell scourges about the feet of the cliffs, in motion beneath them
and the ocean, under the pulsation of light-houses and noise of bell-buoys,
advances as usual, looking as if it were not that ocean in which dropped things are bound to sink
in which if they turn and twist, it is neither with volition nor consciousness.



Sad Poems

#######################################################

A knight lies slain by the southern ford,

												    There is dew on his plume, but no blood on his sword.

												    This morn he rode through the glen, e'er day

												    Had chased the shadows of night away.

												    And I knew he was food for the carrion crow,

												    For I marked how a raven followed him slow,

												    And three times croaked as he wing'd his flight

												    Till he vanished amid the dawning light.

												    For the east was crimsoning fast with red,

												    As the knight drew near to the torrent's bed;

												    Then out of the bushes a magpie flew,

												    But he heeded it not; for the morning dew

												    Was brushed from the grass by the tiny feet,

												    Of her he had ridden so far to meet.

												    And, oh, but that lady's face was fair,

												    And like molten gold was her sunny hair,

												    And her soft slow smile of welcome, it came

											      Like a breeze o'er the corn in some fertile plain.
												  æ
										        At least he died happy, believing her true,

												    They stabbed him behind, and never he knew

												    Close by in the thicket his deadliest foe

												    Had watched for him long in the morning glow.

												    And his fair, false love who had trysted him there,

												    Little sorrow had she for his blood-stained hair;

												    As she left him lying, the carrion crow

												    Croaked loudly with joy as he watched her go.



Life Poems

#######################################################

There was a man who lived a life of fire.

												    Even upon the fabric of Time,

												    Where purple becomes orange

												    And orange purple,

												    THis life glowed,

												    A dire red stain, indelible;

												    Yet when he was dead,

											      He saw that he had not lived.



America Poems

#######################################################

äó_ the beginning.
												  æ
                                                With purpled haze and showered stars, the crowds heaved toward heaven, and bared their chests, with savage eyes that screamed alarms, who played with notes and placed hypnotic words, into colors embracing their nightly rage. I dreamed this rape, when all soothed purple; in mysterious beat, that stalked our moment in time; at the edge of our enlightenment.
                                                æ
												  America! America!

											      God mend thine eväó»ry flaw,

											      Confirm thy soul in self-control,

											    Thy liberty in law.
												  æ
												  These apparitions danced, while the crowd drummed black, and with jungled code they conversed, lashing fiery tongues, until our black faced angels; loosened their hold. Oh worshippers, it was his vulgar-ripped hands, who captured our hopes, who demonized our little tap dancer; the Sermon Dream.
												  æ
												  And it was replaced, our faith, our faith, our faith; with marbled bodies morbid, with murderous overtures, and hooligan priests, their despicable acts, the white barbarism. I saw these heavenly angels, who drank us drunk, les foules fí¢chí©es, je prie pour nous; poor mobs of seer poets, who lived in filthy hotels, with the distracted ghost of Madame Rachou.
												  æ
												  Among the ancients, the artists, the Egyptians, injections of brutishness, and smoke from burning testaments, our moment reflected black to back, that found us huddled under hair, that warmed our skin with naked lightning, thrown from one hit peddlers, the movement went downtown with snickered grins and bust line pimps who fed us our chocolate dust. We ate their scraps and drank their piss, sipping to salvation, without the blood from He, who is never coming.
												  æ
												  äó_ the acts of violence, unspeakable joy.
												  æ
												  The Angel birthed a disciple to wait, to sip his grace then dance below, to visit our tombs, and pray for He, whose second act, a delayed departure, flashes Broadwayäó»s darkened corners.
												  æ
												  The showered stars, the rancid thoughts, the hollowed chests; tracks of pity and fallen words, naked on porcelain lambs, cracked with hope that someone scratched; the King of hearts, the purpled belief, the tap danceräó»s Dream.
												  æ
												  Our faith, our faith, our faith; our bodies become the overture, the awkward rhythm, the Blood and Bread, the grace from He; who dreams of armageddon, then pleasures Himself with hymns of praise.
												  æ
												  äó_ the waters encroach.
												  æ
												  Our fingers plug the desert, while waters gently pour; we lap dance grunt, panting to the written testaments; in mud, in blood, on the skinned infants who lost their chance.
												  æ
												  We danced with a beat or three; to the rolling blankets; the humanity lost, and the gentle touched, by cold and rigid toes; crossed for the Calvary and furious charge.
												  æ
										        The priests of marble, who prayed to Him; were found holding the lanterns, sweet trinkets, fast bullets and fresh water boogie; while the dark was lit, as a guide to His arrival. Hallowed by The name whose eyes openly screamed, who played with notes and fed the words, into colors embracing our nighttime rage.
										        æ
											    God shed His grace on thee,

											      And crown thy good with brotherhood

											      From sea to shining sea!

If I could keep 

												    just one moment in time

												    it would be this äóñ

											      right here, right now.
												  æ
												  A glass beside our bed

												    quivers in the moonlight,

												    brimful with liquid silver;
												  æ
						                        arms above her head

												    she lies, like branches

												    of a cherry tree, heavy

												    with blossom.
						                        æ
											    Tangled sheets bind my feet

												    but I am a willing prisoner, 

												    and through an open window

												    I can hear the stars sing.



Spring Poems

#######################################################

A bird chirped at my window this morning,

												    And over the sky is drawn a light net-work of clouds.

												    Come,

												    Let us go out into the open,

											      For my heart leaps like a fish that is ready to spawn.
												  æ
												  I will lie under the beech-trees,

												    Under the grey branches of the beech-trees,

												    In a blueness of little squills and crocuses.

												    I will lie among the little squills

												    And be delivered of this overcharge of beauty,

												    And that which is born shall be a joy to you

											    Who love me.



Narrative Poems

#######################################################

"Make way for liberty!" he cried,

												    Make way for liberty, and died.

												    In arms the Austrian phalanx stood,

												    A living wall, a human wood,--

												    A wall, where every conscious stone

												    Seemed to its kindred thousands grown.

												    A rampart all assaults to bear,

												    Till time to dust their frames should wear;

												    So still, so dense the Austrians stood,

											      A living wall, a human wood.
												  æ
												  Impregnable their front appears,

												    All horrent with projected spears.

												    Whose polished points before them shine,

												    From flank to flank, one brilliant line,

												    Bright as the breakers' splendours run

												    Along the billows to the sun.
												  æ
												  Opposed to these a hovering band

												    Contended for their fatherland;

												    Peasants, whose new-found strength had broke

												    From manly necks the ignoble yoke,

												    And beat their fetters into swords,

												    On equal terms to fight their lords;

												    And what insurgent rage had gained,

												    In many a mortal fray maintained;

												    Marshalled, once more, at Freedom's call,

												    They came to conquer or to fall,

												    Where he who conquered, he who fell,

												    Was deemed a dead or living Tell,

												    Such virtue had that patriot breathed,

												    So to the soil his soul bequeathed,

												    That wheresoe'er his arrows flew,

												    Heroes in his own likeness grew,

												    And warriors sprang from every sod,

												    Which his awakening footstep trod.
												  æ
												  And now the work of life and death

												    Hung on the passing of a breath;

												    The fire of conflict burned within,

												    The battle trembled to begin;

												    Yet, while the Austrians held their ground,

												    Point for attack was nowhere found;

												    Where'er the impatient Switzers gazed,

												    The unbroken line of lances blazed;

												    That line 'twere suicide to meet,

												    And perish at their tyrant's feet;

												    How could they rest within their graves,

												    And leave their homes, the homes of slaves!

												    Would not they feel their children tread,

												    With clanging chains, above their head?
												  æ
												  It must not be; this day, this hour,

												    Annihilates the invader's power;

												    All Switzerland is in the field;

												    She will not fly,--she cannot yield,--

												    She must not fall; her better fate

												    Here gives her an immortal date.

												    Few were the numbers she could boast,

												    But every freeman was a host,

												    And felt as 'twere a secret known

												    That one should turn the scale alone,

												    While each unto himself was he

												    On whose sole arm hung victory.
												  æ
												  It did depend on one indeed;

												    Behold him,--Arnold Winkelried;

												    There sounds not to the trump of fame

												    The echo of a nobler name.

												    Unmarked he stood amid the throng,

												    In rumination deep and long,

												    Till you might see, with sudden grace,

												    The very thought come o'er his face;

												    And, by the motion of his form,

												    Anticipate the bursting storm,

												    And, by the uplifting of his brow,

												    Tell where the bolt would strike, and how.
												  æ
												  But 'twas no sooner thought than done!

												    The field was in a moment won;

												    "Make way for liberty!" he cried,

												    Then ran, with arms extended wide,

												    As if his dearest friend to clasp;

												    Ten spears he swept within his grasp.

												    "Make way for liberty!" he cried.

												    Their keen points crossed from side to side;

												    He bowed amidst them like a tree,

												    And thus made way for liberty.
												  æ
												  Swift to the breach his comrades fly,

												    "Make way for liberty!" they cry,

												    And through the Austrian phalanx dart,

												    As rushed the spears through Arnold's heart.

												    While instantaneous as his fall,

												    Rout, ruin, panic, seized them all;

												    An earthquake could not overthrow

												    A city with a surer blow.
												  æ
												  Thus Switzerland again was free;

											    Thus Death made way for Liberty!



War Poems

#######################################################

A sight in camp in the daybreak gray and dim,

												    As from my tent I emerge so early sleepless,

												    As slow I walk in the cool fresh air the path near by the hospital tent,

												    Three forms I see on stretchers lying, brought out there untended lying,

												    Over each the blanket spread, ample brownish woolen blanket,

											      Gray and heavy blanket, folding, covering all.
												  æ
												  Curious I halt and silent stand,

												    Then with light fingers I from the face of the nearest the first

												    just lift the blanket;

												    Who are you elderly man so gaunt and grim, with well-gray'd hair,

												    and flesh all sunken about the eyes?

												    Who are you my dear comrade?

												    Then to the second I step--and who are you my child and darling?

												    Who are you sweet boy with cheeks yet blooming?

												    Then to the third--a face nor child nor old, very calm, as of

												    beautiful yellow-white ivory;

												    Young man I think I know you--I think this face is the face of the

												    Christ himself,

											    Dead and divine and brother of all, and here again he lies.



Fairy Poems

#######################################################

There's terrible trouble in Fairyland,

												    I hear from a humming-bird fresh from the border,

												    The impudent sprites of that airy strand

											    Refusing to follow the good old order.
												  æ
												  The elves have deserted both field and glade--

												    "So tired of tending the thankless flowers!"

												    The gnomes have abandoned their pick and spade,

											    Demanding more wages and shorter hours.
												  æ
												  The nixes and mermaids have swum ashore;--

												    "The waters are damp, chill, and uninviting."

												    The witches will dwell in the woods no more;

											    Apartments they want, with electric lighting.
												  æ
												  The monarchs are throwing their scepters down--

												    "It's wearisome work--this eternal reigning!"

												    The queens push their honey aside, and frown,

											    And all through the palace there's complaining.
												  æ
												  The royal-born youths of the golden clime

												    Play football and hockey, and each professes

												    The utmost aversion to wasting time

											    In rescuing maidens with golden tresses.
												  æ
										        And the maidens deplorable taste evince;

												    Her nose in the air, each vows, defiant,

												    That sooner than mate with a stupid prince

												    She'd marry an ogre or lovely giant!
										        æ
											    While the dragon roars from his gloomy hall

												    (And, oh, it isn't a theme for laughter!):

												    "I've swallowed the princess, crown and all,

												    And I'm to 'live happily ever after.'"



Death Poems

#######################################################

In America the 

												    Dead are laid 

												    Out in ordered 

												    Rows beneath a 

												    Projected spread of 

												    Groomed grass saturated

												    With noxious life 

												    Repellent. Incised through 

												    Veins of quartz

												    And pebbled flakes 

												    Of mica are 

												    Phantoms that we 

												    Send for posterity äóñ 

												    Words conveying not 

												    Love, but need 

												    For credit, for 

												    What we have 

											    Done.
												  æ
												  As if we could toll the death of death

												    And seal it within a lavish coffin

												    Behind a weighted fence, we tend to neglect

												    The roses and the fact

												    That the insects are still there

											    And we dare not dwell upon it.
												  æ
										        In a gently tarnished town,

												    Called Litomyçl, where arch-paved walks

												    Emulate the underlying bulges of tree roots

												    And the tower bell thrums

												    Across the stucco and clay tile roofs,

												    Fluid iron gates curve to errant strangers. 

												    I can hear the conversations

												    Of unfamiliar birds that vacillate between

												    Fingers of self-pruning trees.

												    And I can sense an ounce of the feeling

												    For the glowing bones, below

												    In the twining gardens

												    Under their eaves of water and stone. 

												    The rifts widen within,

												    Gratitude touched by radiance

												    Through the patches of light 

												    Resting upon my shoulders.
										        æ
											    I cannot say

												    That one is better,

												    Or worse,

												    Or any other gray comparison.

												    If you want to know something about a country,

												    About a people,

												    You might consider exploring

												    Its cemeteries.



Atlantis Poems

#######################################################

Out in the chill seas of yesterday,

												    Where the waters are aching and break in tear spray,

												    And the beat of the waves that come crashing in pain

												    Are the sob-throbs of anguish and souls gone insane,

												    There's a dear little island--the Land of We Two,

											      Calling to me, sweetheart, calling to you.
												  æ
										        Back o'er the waters and through the tear spray,

												    Saddened and gladdened I'm sailing away,

												    Back to the Land of You Must and You Can't,

												    Back to the game with its big rule of Shan't;

												    Dear little island and wonderful one,

												    Why in the world were you ever begun?



Autumn Poems

#######################################################

This is definitely my favorite time of the year. 

												    Itäó»s right after summer, 

												    which is always a relief, 

												    as the summer heat here 

												    in Southern California can get pretty damn 

												    uncomfortable, 

												    particularly if you live in an old apartment 

												    from the thirties and you donäó»t have 

												    air conditioning. 

												    

												    Just when you canäó»t take the heat 

												    anymore, enduring months of claustrophobic sweat, 

												    a cool breeze begins to creep its way 

												    into the hot afternoons; 

												    and soon, after several weeks, 

												    you begin to feel the calming forest winds 

												    drifting between tree branches 

												    into far away valleys 

												    into the housing or apartment tracts 

												    where you live. 

												    

												    Thereäó»s something so peaceful about this 

												    wind itäó»s almost creepy. 

												    

												    The oncoming winter is in this wind, 

												    the oncoming blizzards and storms, 

												    and the chilling vulnerability 

												    of cold bones. 

												    

												    Crawling beetles are in this wind 

												    and the blossoming of pumpkins. 

												    

												    This is the season when the spider 

												    feels most content, 

												    spinning its web 

												    across the beams of suburban homes. 

												    

												    Its ready to suck blood of insects 

												    with cozy understanding 

												    that death is necessary 

												    for the cycle 

												    of seasons. 

												    

												    These autumn winds 

												    bring with them the haunting madness 

												    of forests. 

												    

												    They bring with them the rustling of dry leaves 

												    and the ants crawling through pine needles. 

												    

												    They bring with them the rat and his rattail 

												    scurrying over a squirrel carcass 

												    filled with squirming maggots. 

  

												    They bring with them the new and old growth 

												    of yellow flowers in a field surrounded by crooked trees. 

  

												    They bring with them the mountains. 

  

												    They bring with them the nostalgic memories 

												    of a childhood Halloween. 

  

												    They bring with them the falling of dead leaves. 

  

												    They bring with them a golden-glow-sunshine. 

  

												    They bring with them the brown and orange colors of fall and the need for family belonging. 

  

												    These winds come to us 

												    from thousands of years of Indian heritage. 

  

												    They come to us 

												    with a language older than language itself. 

  

												    The soul 

												    of the earth is in these winds, the soul 

												    of the universe. 

  

												    Breathe in 

												    the October air 

												    and remember who you are. 

  

												    Youäó»re not the name you go by. 

  

												    Youäó»re something 

												    far 

												    ææmore

You spring up as bamboos up

												    My love¥_ëI am the rain in spring

												    Quenching your thirst

												    Late at night 

											      With my tears upon your leaves

												    My sweetheart

												    Your eyes meet mine in the rustling
								                æ
											    Iäó»m driving the night wind

												    At the edge of our story

												    My love, my age is streaming 

												    As the spring is running

												    Outside are night words whispering

I shall never forget you, Broadway

											      Your golden and calling lights.
												  æ
												  I'll remember you long,

												    Tall-walled river of rush and play.
												  æ
												  Hearts that know you hate you

												    And lips that have given you laughter

												    Have gone to their ashes of life and its roses,

												    Cursing the dreams that were lost

											    In the dust of your harsh and trampled stones.

from Lipstick
										        
												  I ask you, how the hibernating bulb

												    knows when to jerk awake?

												    Pinioned in the ice-dark earth

												    perpetual night of wet and cold

												    How does it know the time has come

												    to push the bleached blind maggoty shoot

												    out into the stone-frost dirt

											    on cue to flower on April 23rd?
												  æ
										        I dare you, take a bulb and strip away

												    its glossy, coppery paper shell

												    the onion-like white folds on folds

												    and show me where it keeps the clock

												    or microchip which tells it when to start

												    so it will flower to the day with its companions

												    however chill and damp the spring.

												    One laggard never oversleeps and pops up in September.
										        æ
											    I defy you, take the spiralling DNA of me

												    the pumping, wooshing ventricles,

												    the zing-charged porridge in my head,

												    and show me where I keep the love for you

												    that will outlast my life.



Christmas Poems

#######################################################

Christmas-Eve! and all unruffled

												    Dumb white spectral billows grow,

												    Till the city's heart is muffled

												    In a deep, wide pall of snow,

												    Dead'ning clash of clang and clamor,

												    All the sound of tramping feet,

												    Folded by the Ice-king's glamour

												    In a wondrous winding-sheet.

												    Noiselessly his looms are weaving

												    Snowy warp and crystal woof;

												    Silently the winds are leaving

												    Draperies on spire and roof.

												    Laughing eyes that have been watching

												    For the snow so long in vain

												    Sleep, while elfish Frost is etching

												    Pictures on the window-pane.

												    Three bright little sleepers dreaming,--

												    Dreaming of the Christmas snow;

												    Three bright little stockings gleaming

												    Near the chimney in a row.

												    See a lady, softly gliding,

												    By each fair young sleeper pause,

												    Lest they wake and find her hiding

												    Treasures brought by "Santa Claus."

												    As she bends above the fairest,

												    Wondering eyes are opened wide;

												    Comes a whisper: "Mamma dearest,

												    I've had such a lovely ride."

												    "You were dreaming." "Yes, I know it,--

												    Such a pity, too, because

												    It was splendid fun to 'go it'

												    In a sleigh with 'Santa Claus.'

												    I was skating down the river,

												    Far away from all the rest,

												    Near the rocks where ice-spears quiver

												    Up above its frozen breast,

												    When a peal of bells came ringing--

												    Silver bells--in perfect time,

												    Like a band of spirits singing.

												    Soft they pealed a Christmas chime,

												    Every moment louder, clearer,

												    Till I saw a fairy sleigh

												    Gliding towards me,--nearer, nearer,--

												    Down the river's frozen way.

												    As it passed me, on I skated

												    Swiftly in its track, because

												    The elf behind that gay team seated

												    Was our dear old Santa Claus.

												    How he laughed to see me follow!

												    When I kissed my hand he cried,

												    'We fly faster than the swallow;

												    Little one, come take a ride.

												    Leave your skates upon the river;

												    There! jump in; but what you see

												    Must be secret, kept forever

												    Secret between you and me.'

												    Onward, onward we were sweeping

												    To an elfin land of rime,

												    Where the winter fays were keeping

												    Their enchanted Christmas-time.

												    On the snow-flakes they were riding,

												    Little dainty, white-winged fays,

												    Down the slender ice-spears sliding,

												    Chasing us in acorn sleighs,

												    From the frosted tree-tops swinging,

												    Countless throngs, with one accord,

												    They were softly, sweetly singing,

												    Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!

												    Far away from wood and river

												    Sped we, over fields of snow,

												    While beside us, onward ever,

												    Did that throng of fairies go,--

												    Beautiful mid-winter fairies,

												    With their crystal crowns and wings,

												    Skimming o'er the frozen prairies,

												    Swinging in their moonbeam swings.

												    Down the boreal streamers sliding,

												    Green, and blue, and violet fays

												    In soft airy circles gliding,

												    Clothed with splendor by the rays.

												    And beneath that borealis,

												    With its frozen domes and spires,

												    Stood old Santa's mystic palace,

												    Lighted by the northern fires.

												    Countless Christmas-trees were springing

												    From its wide, thick, icy floors,

												    And the toys upon them swinging

												    Would have filled ten thousand stores.

												    Ah! such lovely Christmas treasures,--

												    Dolls, books, kites, such lovely things,

												    Sugar-plums in bushel measures,

												    Candy-fruit, and hearts, and rings.

												    'You have robbed the world, Kriss Kringle,'

												    All amazed, at last I said.

												    How his merry eyes did twinkle,

												    As he drolly shook his head!

												    'Bless the children, little dearies!'

												    Toiling in their caves of rime

												    The beautiful mid-winter fairies

												    Make these toys for Christmas-time.

												    Then I heard the bright fays singing,

												    'Peace, good-will.' As Santa spoke,

												    Christmas chimes came softly ringing,

												    You looked at me,--and I woke."

												    "Darling, thank our dear Redeemer,"--

												    And the lady sadly smiled,--

												    "That you sleep a happy dreamer,

												    That you wake a happy child;

												    For poor children, sad and lonely,

												    Santa has no toys to give;

												    They care not for Christmas, only

												    Craving food enough to live.

												    Listen, love. As I was coming

												    Homeward down the crowded street,

												    A ragged little outcast, roaming

												    Through the snow with naked feet,

												    Overtook me, and unfolding

												    A pictorial, said, 'I came

												    To ask you ma'am,'--a print upholding,--

												    'Please to tell me what's his name.'

												    'Why, that is Santa Claus.' 'I never

												    Heard of him.' 'He comes,' I said,

												    'With Christmas toys.' 'Oh! does he ever

												    Bring the hungry children bread?'

												    'He might,' I answered, half in wonder,

												    For the child had turned and fled

												    Down the street, and vanished under-

												    Neath a lonely cottage shed.

												    Quick I followed, softly stealing

												    Near a broken pane, and there

												    To that torn, soiled picture kneeling--

												    Placed before her on a chair--

												    Was the little outcast, praying,

												    Light from her sad, longing eyes

												    Out beyond that dark roof, straying

												    To her Santa, in the skies.

												    And a sweet voice, full of sorrow,

												    Rose beyond that wretched shed:

												    'Please come, dear Santa Claus, tomorrow,

											    And bring us two big loaves of bread.'"
												  æ
										        "He can hear her, mamma, can't he?

												    Won't he go there when he comes?

												    She is starved, to beg from Santa

												    Bread, instead of sugar-plums."
										        æ
											    Sleep again, sweet little dreamer:

												    There is one to plead her cause,--

												    A human God, a kind Redeemer,

												    More human than Santa Claus.

He stood before her tall and very strong.

												    The swine and tigers crouched about her feet

												    And licked them.

												    His glance upon her was indifferent,

												    Whereat her gray eyes blazed with sudden joy,

												    Eager she stretched her arms out, radiant,

												    Her mouth grown sweet and tender, all her form

												    Trembling with hope. Her very smile rejoiced,

												    Then quivered at his kindled look.

												    E'er he had reached the spot where yet she stood

												    Her joy had smouldered out.

The sting in a limbering spring day

												    foreshadows summer. Through her window

												    roses plait themselves together beside young-

												    leafed eucalypts as she, too ill to speak,

												    slowly becomes my eye in the clouds, the gap

												    I will see through. No one knows me better

											    than she who circled my first flight.
											    æ
												  Iäó»ve tried to prepare myself, remembering

												    her cyclopaedic mind, her gift for solutions.

											    My bird-mother. I reach out, hold her hands.
											    æ
												  She slides down into sleep and wakes again

												    on this final island, where touch is more important 

												    than words. She grimaces, begs for morphine . . .

											      Our world divides. Weäó»ll fly differently now.

Love Poems

#######################################################

And you remember, in the afternoon

												    The sea and the sky went grey, as if there had sunk

												    A flocculent dust on the floor of the world: the festoon

												    Of the sky sagged dusty as spider cloth,

											      And coldness clogged the sea, till it ceased to croon.
												  æ
												  A dank, sickening scent came up from the grime

												    Of weed that blackened the shore, so that I recoiled

												    Feeling the raw cold dun me: and all the time

												    You leapt about on the slippery rocks, and threw

												    The words that rang with a brassy, shallow chime.
												  æ
												  And all day long that raw and ancient cold

												    Deadened me through, till the grey downs darkened to sleep.

												    Then I longed for you with your mantle of love to fold

												    Me over, and drive from out of my body the deep

												    Cold that had sunk to my soul, and there kept hold.
												  æ
												  But still to me all evening long you were cold,

												    And I was numb with a bitter, deathly ache;

												    Till old days drew me back into their fold,

												    And dim sheep crowded me warm with companionship,

												    And old ghosts clustered me close, and sleep was cajoled.
												  æ
												  I slept till dawn at the window blew in like dust,

												    Like the linty, raw-cold dust disturbed from the floor

												    Of a disused room: a grey pale light like must

												    That settled upon my face and hands till it seemed

												    To flourish there, as pale mould blooms on a crust.
												  æ
												  Then I rose in fear, needing you fearfully,

												    For I thought you were warm as a sudden jet of blood.

												    I thought I could plunge in your spurting hotness, and be

												    Clean of the cold and the must.--With my hand on the latch

												    I heard you in your sleep speak strangely to me.
												  æ
												  And I dared not enter, feeling suddenly dismayed.

												    So I went and washed my deadened flesh in the sea

												    And came back tingling clean, but worn and frayed

												    With cold, like the shell of the moon: and strange it seems

											    That my love has dawned in rose again, like the love of a maid.

												  												    Flood-tide below me! I see you face to face!

												    Clouds of the west--sun there half an hour high--I see you also face

												    to face.
												  æ
												  Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious

												    you are to me!

												    On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning

												    home, are more curious to me than you suppose,

												    And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more

												    to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose.
											    
												     2
											    
												  												    The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day,

												    The simple, compact, well-join'd scheme, myself disintegrated, every

												    one disintegrated yet part of the scheme,

												    The similitudes of the past and those of the future,

												    The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings, on

												    the walk in the street and the passage over the river,

												    The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away,

												    The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them,

												    The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others.
												  æ
												  Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore,

												    Others will watch the run of the flood-tide,

												    Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the

												    heights of Brooklyn to the south and east,

												    Others will see the islands large and small;

												    Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half

												    an hour high,

												    A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others

												    will see them,

												    Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the

												    falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide.
											    
												     3
											    
												  												    It avails not, time nor place--distance avails not,

												    I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many

												    generations hence,

												    Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt,

												    Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd,

												    Just as you are refresh'd by the gladness of the river and the

												    bright flow, I was refresh'd,

												    Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift

												    current, I stood yet was hurried,

												    Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the

												    thick-stemm'd pipes of steamboats, I look'd.
												  æ
												  I too many and many a time cross'd the river of old,

												    Watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them high in the air

												    floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,

												    Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left

												    the rest in strong shadow,

												    Saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south,

												    Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,

												    Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,

												    Look'd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my

												    head in the sunlit water,

												    Look'd on the haze on the hills southward and south-westward,

												    Look'd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,

												    Look'd toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving,

												    Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,

												    Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor,

												    The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars,

												    The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender

												    serpentine pennants,

												    The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilothouses,

												    The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels,

												    The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset,

												    The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the

												    frolic-some crests and glistening,

												    The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the

												    granite storehouses by the docks,

												    On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank'd on

												    each side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated lighter,

												    On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning

												    high and glaringly into the night,

												    Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow

												    light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets.
											    
												     4
											    
												  												    These and all else were to me the same as they are to you,

												    I loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river,

												    The men and women I saw were all near to me,

												    Others the same--others who look back on me because I look'd forward

												    to them,

												    (The time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.)
											    
												     5
											    
												  												    What is it then between us?

												    What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?
												  æ
												  Whatever it is, it avails not--distance avails not, and place avails not,

												    I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine,

												    I too walk'd the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in the

												    waters around it,

												    I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,

												    In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me,

												    In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me,

												    I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution,

												    I too had receiv'd identity by my body,

												    That I was I knew was of my body, and what I should be I knew I

												    should be of my body.
											    
												     6
											    
												  												    It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,

												    The dark threw its patches down upon me also,

												    The best I had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious,

												    My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?

												    Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil,

												    I am he who knew what it was to be evil,

												    I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,

												    Blabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd,

												    Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,

												    Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant,

												    The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me.

												    The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting,
												  æ
												  Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting,

												    Was one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest,

												    Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as

												    they saw me approaching or passing,

												    Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of

												    their flesh against me as I sat,

												    Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet

												    never told them a word,

												    Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping,

												    Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,

												    The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like,

												    Or as small as we like, or both great and small.
											    
												     7
											    
												  												    Closer yet I approach you,

												    What thought you have of me now, I had as much of you--I laid in my

												    stores in advance,

												    I consider'd long and seriously of you before you were born.
												  æ
												  Who was to know what should come home to me?

												    Who knows but I am enjoying this?

												    Who knows, for all the distance, but I am as good as looking at you

												    now, for all you cannot see me?
											    
												     8
											    
												  												    Ah, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than

												    mast-hemm'd Manhattan?

												    River and sunset and scallop-edg'd waves of flood-tide?

												    The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the

												    twilight, and the belated lighter?

												    What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with voices I

												    love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as approach?

												    What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that

												    looks in my face?

												    Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you?
												  æ
												  We understand then do we not?

												    What I promis'd without mentioning it, have you not accepted?

												    What the study could not teach--what the preaching could not

												    accomplish is accomplish'd, is it not?
											    
												     9
											    
												  												    Flow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide!

												    Frolic on, crested and scallop-edg'd waves!

												    Gorgeous clouds of the sunset! drench with your splendor me, or the

												    men and women generations after me!

												    Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers!

												    Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta! stand up, beautiful hills of Brooklyn!

												    Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers!

												    Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!

												    Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public assembly!

												    Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my

												    nighest name!

												    Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress!

												    Play the old role, the role that is great or small according as one

												    makes it!

												    Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be

												    looking upon you;

												    Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet

												    haste with the hasting current;

												    Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air;

												    Receive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till all

												    downcast eyes have time to take it from you!

												    Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any

												    one's head, in the sunlit water!

												    Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail'd

												    schooners, sloops, lighters!

												    Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower'd at sunset!

												    Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at

												    nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses!

												    Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are,

												    You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul,

												    About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung our divinest aromas,

												    Thrive, cities--bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and

												    sufficient rivers,

												    Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual,

												    Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.
												  æ
												  You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers,

												    We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward,

												    Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us,

												    We use you, and do not cast you aside--we plant you permanently within us,

												    We fathom you not--we love you--there is perfection in you also,

												    You furnish your parts toward eternity,

											    Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.



Love Poems

You came to me bearing bright roses,

												    Red like the wine of your heart;

												    You twisted them into a garland

												    To set me aside from the mart.

												    Red roses to crown me your lover,

											      And I walked aureoled and apart.
												  æ
												  Enslaved and encircled, I bore it,

												    Proud token of my gift to you.

												    The petals waned paler, and shriveled,

												    And dropped; and the thorns started through.

												    Bitter thorns to proclaim me your lover,

											    A diadem woven with rue.



Love

#######################################################

What large, dark hands are those at the window
Lifted, grasping the golden light
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves
       To my heart's delight?

Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,
In the west I see a redness come
Over the evening's burning breast 
        'Tis the wound of love goes home!

The woodbine creeps abroad
Calling low to her lover:
The sun-lit flirt who all the day
Has poised above her lips in play
And stolen kisses, shallow and gay
Of pollen, now has gone away
 She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,
And when above her his broad wings hover
Then her bright breast she will uncover
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.

Into the yellow, evening glow
Saunters a man from the farm below,
Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed
Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.
The bird lies warm against the wall.
She glances quick her startled eyes
Towards him, then she turns away
Her small head, making warm display
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway
Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies
In one blue stoop from out the sties
Into the evening's empty hall.

Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes
Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,
Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.

The rabbit presses back her ears,
Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes
And crouches low: then with wild spring
Spurts from the terror of his oncoming
To be choked back, the wire ring
Her frantic effort throttling:
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!

Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes
And ready to open in brown surprise
Should I not answer to his talk
Or should he my tears surmise.

I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair
Watching the door open: he flashes bare
His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board
And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword
Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud
His coming: he raises up my face to him
And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim
Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!
I know not what fine wire is round my throat,
I only know I let him finger there
My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:
And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood
Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood
Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown
Within him, die, and find death good.



Morning Poems

#######################################################

When night is almost done,

												    And sunrise grows so near

												    That we can touch the spaces,

											      It 's time to smooth the hair
												  æ
												  And get the dimples ready,

												    And wonder we could care

												    For that old faded midnight

											    That frightened but an hour.



Bird Poems

#######################################################

The birds of Stymphalus

												    Vexed not so the Arcadians,

												    As those dead thrushes vexed me

												    With their dry bones,

												    Very harpies,

												    Ten of them,

												    A dry drachma's worth.

												    Out on you, wretched creatures,

											      True bats of the fields.



Death Poems

#######################################################

I shall walk down the road.

												    I shall turn and feel upon my feet

												    The kisses of Death, like scented rain.

												    For Death is a black slave with little silver birds

												    Perched in a sleeping wreath upon his head.

												    He will tell me, his voice like jewels

												    Dropped into a satin bag,

												    How he has tip-toed after me down the road,

												    His heart made a dark whirlpool with longing for me.

												    Then he will graze me with his hands

												    And I shall be one of the sleeping, silver birds

												    Between the cold waves of his hair, as he tip-toes on.



Moon Poems

#######################################################

Drag your white skull beyond blind seas

												    that tumble dazed to you mono-eyed magic.

												    Go tell Neptune when the night is through. 

												    Charm him, too, with your waxing and waning. 

												    But you canäó»t catch me with those veiled half smiles. 

												    Your borrowed brilliance exposes you.

												    I know your darker side. 

											      Go charm some other star struck rhapsodist.



Love Poems

#######################################################

I. TERRACE
										        
												  As they sat sipping their glasses in the courtyard

												    Of the Hotel de la Tigresse Verte,

												    With their silk-swathed ankles softly kissing,

												    They were certain that they had forever

												    Imprisoned fickleness in the vodka--

											    They knew they had found the ultimate pulse of love.
												  æ
												  Story upon story, the dark windows whispered down

												    To them from above, and over the roof's edge

											    Danced a grey moon.
												  æ
												  The woman pressed her chicken-skin fan against her breast

												    And through her ran trepidant mutinies of desire

												    With treacheries of emotion. Her voice vapoured:

												    "In which room shall it be tonight, darling?"

												    His eyes swept the broad facade, the windows,

												    Tier upon tier, and his lips were regnant:

											    "In every room, my beloved!"
												  
												    II. LOYALTY
										        
										        I am kissing your wayward feet--

												    The rumours of flight are broken,

												    Your hands are a dear pale token.

												    I adore you to touch me, sweet,

												    And now are the frail vows spoken.
										        æ
											    It is bravely the words are said,

												    Faith is a flash on our faces--

												    We mock as the mummer traces

												    The dawn when the month is dead,

												    Loyalty mussed like your laces.



War Poems

#######################################################

The last sunbeam

												    Lightly falls from the finish'd Sabbath,

												    On the pavement here, and there beyond it is looking,

											      Down a new-made double grave.
												  æ
												   Lo, the moon ascending,

												    Up from the east the silvery round moon,

												    Beautiful over the house-tops, ghastly, phantom moon,

												    Immense and silent moon.
												  æ
												   I see a sad procession,

												    And I hear the sound of coming full-key'd bugles,

												    All the channels of the city streets they're flooding,

												    As with voices and with tears.
												  æ
												   I hear the great drums pounding,

												    And the small drums steady whirring,

												    And every blow of the great convulsive drums,

												    Strikes me through and through.
												  æ
												   For the son is brought with the father,

												    (In the foremost ranks of the fierce assault they fell,

												    Two veterans son and father dropt together,

												    And the double grave awaits them.)
												  æ
												   Now nearer blow the bugles,

												    And the drums strike more convulsive,

												    And the daylight o'er the pavement quite has faded,

												    And the strong dead-march enwraps me.
												  æ
												   In the eastern sky up-buoying,

												    The sorrowful vast phantom moves illumin'd,

												    ('Tis some mother's large transparent face,

												    In heaven brighter growing.)
												  æ
												   O strong dead-march you please me!

												    O moon immense with your silvery face you soothe me!

												    O my soldiers twain! O my veterans passing to burial!

												    What I have I also give you.
												  æ
												   The moon gives you light,

												    And the bugles and the drums give you music,

												    And my heart, O my soldiers, my veterans,

											    My heart gives you love.



Love

#######################################################

Down by the salley gardens
   my love and I did meet;
She passed the salley gardens
   with little snow-white feet.
She bid me take love easy,
   as the leaves grow on the tree;
But I, being young and foolish,
   with her would not agree.

In a field by the river
   my love and I did stand,
And on my leaning shoulder
   she laid her snow-white hand.
She bid me take life easy,
   as the grass grows on the weirs;
But I was young and foolish,
   and now am full of tears.
 



Women Poems

#######################################################

You will come one day in a waver of love,

												    Tender as dew, impetuous as rain,

												    The tan of the sun will be on your skin,

												    The purr of the breeze in your murmuring speech,

											      You will pose with a hill-flower grace.
												  æ
												  You will come, with your slim, expressive arms,

												    A poise of the head no sculptor has caught

												    And nuances spoken with shoulder and neck,

												    Your face in a pass-and-repass of moods

												    As many as skies in delicate change

												    Of cloud and blue and flimmering sun.
												  æ
												  Yet,

												    You may not come, O girl of a dream,

												    We may but pass as the world goes by

												    And take from a look of eyes into eyes,

											    A film of hope and a memorial day.



New York Poems

#######################################################

An old Jew munches an apple,

												    With conquering immersion

												    All the thwarted longings of his life

												    Urge on his determined teeth.

												    His face is hard and pear-shaped;

												    His eyes are muddy capitulations;

												    But his mouth is incongruous.

												    Softly, slightly distended,

												    Like that of a whistling girl,

												    It is ingenuously haunting

												    And makes the rest of him a soiled, grey background.

												    Hopes that lie within their grave

												    Of submissive sternness,

												    Have spilled their troubled ghosts upon this mouth,

												    And a tortured belief

												    Has dwindled into tenderness upon it ...

												    He trudges off behind his push-cart

											      And the Ghetto walks away with him.



Love Poems

#######################################################

I know what my heart is like

												    Since your love died:

												    It is like a hollow ledge

												    Holding a little pool

												    Left there by the tide,

												    A little tepid pool,

											      Drying inward from the edge.



Death Poems

#######################################################

There will be rose and rhododendron

												    When you are dead and under ground;

												    Still will be heard from white syringas

											    Heavy with bees, a sunny sound;
												  æ
												  Still will the tamaracks be raining

												    After the rain has ceased, and still

												    Will there be robins in the stubble,

											    Brown sheep upon the warm green hill.
												  æ
												  Spring will not ail nor autumn falter;

												    Nothing will know that you are gone,

												    Saving alone some sullen plough-land

												    None but yourself sets foot upon;
												  æ
								                Saving the may-weed and the pig-weed

												    Nothing will know that you are dead--

												    These, and perhaps a useless wagon

												    Standing beside some tumbled shed.
								                æ
											    Oh, there will pass with your great passing

												    Little of beauty not your own--

												    Only the light from common water,

												    Only the grace from simple stone!



Love Poems

#######################################################

PATIENCE, little Heart.

												    One day a heavy, June-hot woman

											      Will enter and shut the door to stay.
												  æ
												  And when your stifling heart would summon

												    Cool, lonely night, her roused breasts will keep the night at bay,

												    Sitting in your room like two tiger-lilies

												    Flaming on after sunset,

												    Destroying the cool, lonely night with the glow of their hot twilight;

												    There in the morning, still, while the fierce strange scent comes yet

												    Stronger, hot and red; till you thirst for the daffodillies

												    With an anguished, husky thirst that you cannot assuage,

												    When the daffodillies are dead, and a woman of the dog-days holds you in gage.

											    Patience, little Heart.



Love Poems

#######################################################

How empty seems the town now you are gone!

												    A wilderness of sad streets, where gaunt walls

												    Hide nothing to desire; sunshine falls

												    Eery, distorted, as it long had shone

												    On white, dead faces tombed in halls of stone.

												    The whir of motors, stricken through with calls

												    Of playing boys, floats up at intervals;

												    But all these noises blur to one long moan.

												    What quest is worth pursuing?  And how strange

												    That other men still go accustomed ways!

												    I hate their interest in the things they do.

												    A spectre-horde repeating without change

												    An old routine.  Alone I know the days

											      Are still-born, and the world stopped, lacking you.



Nature

#######################################################

Perspective never withers from their eyes;   
They keep that docile edict of the Spring
That blends March with August Antarctic skies:   
These are but cows that see no other thing   
Than grass and snow, and their own inner being   
Through the rich halo that they do not trouble   
Even to cast upon the seasons fleeting
Though they should thin and die on last years stubble.

And they are awkward, ponderous and uncoy . . .   
While we who press the cider mill, regarding them
We, who with pledges taste the bright annoy   
Of friendships acid wine, retarding phlegm,
Shifting reprisals (til who shall tell us when
The jest is too sharp to be kindly?) boast
Much of our store of faith in other men
Who would, ourselves, stalk down the merriest ghost.

Above them old Mizzentop, palatial white   
Hostelryfloor by floor to cinquefoil dormer   
Portholes the ceilings stack their stoic height.   
Long tiers of windows staring out toward former   
Facesloose panes crown the hill and gleam   
At sunset with a silent, cobwebbed patience . . .   

See them, like eyes that still uphold some dream   
Through mapled vistas, cancelled reservations!

High from the central cupola, they say
Ones glance could cross the borders of three states;   
But I have seen deaths stare in slow survey   
From four horizons that no one relates . . .   
Weekenders avid of their turf-won scores,
Here three hours from the semaphores, the Czars
Of golf, by twos and threes in plaid plusfours   
Alight with sticks abristle and cigars.

This was the Promised Land, and still it is
To the persuasive suburban land agent
In bootleg roadhouses where the gin fizz
Bubbles in time to Hollywoods new love-nest pageant.   
Fresh from the radio in the old Meeting House   
(Now the New Avalon Hotel) volcanoes roar
A welcome to highsteppers that no mouse
Who saw the Friends there ever heard before.

What cunning neighbors history has in fine!   
The woodlouse mortgages the ancient deal   
Table that Powitzky buys for only nine-   
Ty-five at Adams auction,eats the seal,   
The spinster polish of antiquity . . .   
Who holds the lease on time and on disgrace?   
What eats the pattern with ubiquity?
Where are my kinsmen and the patriarch race?

The resigned factions of the dead preside.   
Dead rangers bled their comfort on the snow;   
But I must ask slain Iroquois to guide
Me farther than scalped Yankees knew to go:   
Shoulder the curse of sundered parentage,   
Wait for the postman driving from Birch Hill   
With birthright by blackmail, the arrant page   
That unfolds a new destiny to fill . . . .   

So, must we from the hawks far stemming view,   
Must we descend as worms eye to construe   
Our love of all we touch, and take it to the Gate
As humbly as a guest who knows himself too late,
His news already told? Yes, while the heart is wrung,
Ariseyes, take this sheaf of dust upon your tongue!
In one last angelus lift throbbing throat
Listen, transmuting silence with that stilly note

Of pain that Emily, that Isadora knew!
While high from dim elm-chancels hung with dew,
That triple-noted clause of moonlight
Yes, whip-poor-will, unhusks the heart of fright,
Breaks us and saves, yes, breaks the heart, yet yields
That patience that is armour and that shields
Love from despairwhen love forsees the end
Leaf after autumnal leaf
                                    break off,
                                                   descend
                                                               descend



Love

#######################################################

I wanted you, nameless Woman of the South,
No wraith, but utterlyas still more alone
The Southern Cross takes night
And lifts her girdles from her, one by one
High, cool,
wide from the slowly smoldering fire
Of lower heavens,
vaporous scars!

Eve! Magdalene!
or Mary, you?

Whatever callfalls vainly on the wave.
O simian Venus, homeless Eve,
Unwedded, stumbling gardenless to grieve
Windswept guitars on lonely decks forever;
Finally to answer all within one grave!

And this long wake of phosphor,
iridescent
Furrow of all our traveltrailed derision!
Eyes crumble at its kiss. Its long-drawn spell
Incites a yell. Slid on that backward vision
The mind is churned to spittle, whispering hell.

I wanted you . . . The embers of the Cross
Climbed by aslant and huddling aromatically.
It is blood to remember; it is fire
To stammer back . . . It is
Godyour namelessness. And the wash

All night the water combed you with black
Insolence. You crept out simmering, accomplished.
Water rattled that stinging coil, your
Rehearsed hairdocile, alas, from many arms.
Yes, Evewraith of my unloved seed!

The Cross, a phantom, buckleddropped below the dawn.
Light drowned the lithic trillions of your spawn.



Flower Poems

#######################################################

Why do the lilies goggle their tongues at me

												    When I pluck them;

												    And writhe, and twist,

												    And strangle themselves against my fingers,

												    So that I can hardly weave the garland

												    For your hair?

												    Why do they shriek your name

												    And spit at me

												    When I would cluster them?

												    Must I kill them

												    To make them lie still,

												    And send you a wreath of lolling corpses

												    To turn putrid and soft

												    On your forehead

											      While you dance?



Mythological

#######################################################

I leaned against the mantel, sick, sick,
Thinking of my failure, looking into the abysm,
Weak from the noon-day heat.
A church bell sounded mournfully far away,
I heard the cry of a baby,
And the coughing of John Yarnell,
Bed-ridden, feverish, feverish, dying,
Then the violent voice of my wife:
"Watch out, the potatoes are burning!"
I smelled them ... then there was irresistible disgust.
I pulled the trigger ... blackness ... light ...
Unspeakable regret ... fumbling for the world again.
Too late! Thus I came here,
With lungs for breathing ... one cannot breathe here with lungs,
Though one must breathe
Of what use is it To rid one's self of the world,
When no soul may ever escape the eternal destiny of life?



Bird Poems

#######################################################

When the sun rose I was still lying in bed;

												    An early oriole sang on the roof of my house.

												    For a moment I thought of the Royal Park at dawn

												    When the Birds of Spring greeted their Lord from his trees.

												    I remember the days when I served before the Throne

												    Pencil in hand, on duty at the Ch'eng-ming;

												    At the height of spring, when I paused an instant from work,

												    Morning and evening, was this the voice I heard?

												    Now in my exile the oriole sings again

												    In the dreary stillness of Hsí_n-yang town ...

												    The bird's note cannot really have changed;

												    All the difference lies in the listener's heart.

												    If he could but forget that he lives at the World's end,

											    The bird would sing as it sang in the Palace of old.



God Poems

#######################################################

If His brush strokes are the green carpet of moss on an Irish rock,

												    the velvet blue of butterfly wings that caress a tree,

												    and the liquid peaches of an afternoon sky preparing to sleep

												    If they are the silver dew clinging to a spider's web,

												    the fat grays of building storm clouds,

												    and the black of a starless night when my voice calls

												    Then it is here,

												    in the midnight colors,

											      that I see His hand most.
												  

												    When I am alone with the chafe of a lonely heart,

												    and the sores inside that no one can see,

												    then I remember how stark an artist's canvas is before the painting.

												    How white a page is before I write upon it.

												    And I am full of hope. Because perhaps I am a color yet placed,

												    a word yet read...

												    and I wonder at the beauty of life yet to come,

												    If this is how God paints.



Moon Poems

#######################################################

A.D. 805
											    
												  In early summer, with two or three more

												    That were seeking fame in the city of Ch'ang-an,

												    Whose low employ gave them less business

												    Than ever they had since first they left their homes--

												    With these I wandered deep into the shrine of Tao,

												    For the joy we sought was promised in this place.

												    When we reached the gate, we sent our coaches back;

												    We entered the yard with only cap and stick.

												    Still and clear, the first weeks of May,

												    When trees are green and bushes soft and wet;

												    When the wind has stolen the shadows of new leaves

												    And birds linger on the last boughs that bloom.

												    Towards evening when the sky grew clearer yet

												    And the South-east was still clothed in red,

												    To the western cloister we carried our jar of wine;

												    While we waited for the moon, our cups moved slow.

												    Soon, how soon her golden ghost was born,

												    Swiftly, as though she had waited for us to come.

												    The beams of her light shone in every place,

												    On towers and halls dancing to and fro.

												    Till day broke we sat in her clear light

												    Laughing and singing, and yet never grew tired.

												    In Ch'ang-an, the place of profit and fame,

											    Such moods as this, how many men know?



Women Poems

#######################################################

Women of night life amid the lights

												    Where the line of your full, round throats

												    Matches in gleam the glint of your eyes

												    And the ring of your heart-deep laughter:

											      It is much to be warm and sure of to-morrow.
												  æ
												  Women of night life along the shadows,

												    Lean at your throats and skulking the walls,

												    Gaunt as a bitch worn to the bone,

												    Under the paint of your smiling faces:

											    It is much to be warm and sure of to-morrow.



Love Poems

#######################################################

Miles from you I turn and find you,

												    My beloved. And your gaze

												    And the ripple of your garment

												    And your unexpected ways

												    Of approaching and of speaking

												    And the breath of your hair

												    Are as real to me as rain is

											      Through hot summer air.
												  æ
										        In far companies I meet you

												    Moving natural and clear,

												    Coming toward me in your beauty ...

												    O, be careful, they will hear,

												    They will look at us, these others,

												    They will listen when your hand

												    Touches tumult on my shoulder--

												    Like the surf on the sand!



Life Poems

#######################################################

Life is more sweet than I

												    Knew: the shifted scene

												    Less wavered, more trimmed with light,

												    Than the years before.

												    Look down. People pass over the ice

												    As a file of thin ghosts creep,

												    And fade beyond the hill.

												    You, and you, and you--

												    Small souls, shrinking away.

												    And you, and you, and you,

												    Bearing lights in your hands,

												    Approaching eternally..... Life is

											      More sweet than I knew.



Love Poems

#######################################################

I saw the midlands

												    Revolve through her hair;

												    The fields of autumn

												    Stretching bare,

												    And sheep on the pasture

											      Tossed back in a scare.
												  æ
												  And still as ever

												    The world went round,

												    My mouth on her pulsing

												    Neck was found,

												    And my breast to her beating

												    Breast was bound.
												  æ
												  But my heart at the centre

												    Of all, in a swound

												    Was still as a pivot,

												    As all the ground

												    On its prowling orbit

												    Shifted round.
												  æ
												  And still in my nostrils

												    The scent of her flesh,

												    And still my wet mouth

												    Sought her afresh;

												    And still one pulse

												    Through the world did thresh.
												  æ
												  And the world all whirling

												    Around in joy

												    Like the dance of a dervish

												    Did destroy

												    My sense--and my reason

												    Spun like a toy.
												  æ
												  But firm at the centre

												    My heart was found;

												    Her own to my perfect

												    Heart-beat bound,

												    Like a magnet's keeper

											    Closing the round.



War Poems

#######################################################

from Lipstick
										        
												  In war time women turn to red

												    swivel-up scarlet and carmine

												    not in solidarity with spilt blood

											    but as a badge of beating hearts.
												  æ
												  This crimson is the shade of poets

												    silenced for speaking against torture,

												    this vermillion is art

											    surviving solitary confinement,
												  æ
									            this cerise defies the falling bombs

												    the snipers taking aim at bread-queues,

												    this rubyäó»s the resilience of girls

												    who tango in the pale-lipped face of death.
										        
										          (Based on observations in Bosnia and Afghanistan by war photographer Jenny Matthews.
										          Confirmed by the Max Factor catalogue 1945.)



Sad Poems

#######################################################

A chieftain, to the Highlands bound, 

												    Cries, "Boatman, do not tarry! 

												    And I'll give thee a silver pound 

											      To row us o'er the ferry!''-- 
												  æ
												  "Now, who be ye, would cross Lochgyle, 

												    This dark and stormy weather?'' 

												    "O, I'm the chief of Ulva's isle, 

												    And this, Lord Ullin's daughter.-- 
												  æ
												  "And fast before her father's men 

												    Three days we've fled together, 

												    For should he find us in the glen, 

												    My blood would stain the heather. 
												  æ
												  "His horsemen hard behind us ride; 

												    Should they our steps discover, 

												    Then who will cheer my bonny bride 

												    When they have slain her lover?''-- 
												  æ
												  Out spoke the hardy Highland wight,-- 

												    "I'll go, my chief--I'm ready:-- 

												    It is not for your silver bright; 

												    But for your winsome lady: 
												  æ
												  "And by my word! the bonny bird 

												    In danger shall not tarry; 

												    So, though the waves are raging white, 

												    I'll row you o'er the ferry.''-- 
												  æ
												  By this the storm grew loud apace, 

												    The water-wraith was shrieking; 

												    And in the scowl of heaven each face 

												    Grew dark as they were speaking. 
												  æ
												  But still as wilder blew the wind, 

												    And as the night grew drearer, 

												    Adown the glen rode armíÂd men, 

												    Their trampling sounded nearer.-- 
												  æ
												  "O haste thee, haste!'' the lady cries, 

												    "Though tempests round us gather; 

												    I'll meet the raging of the skies, 

												    But not an angry father.''--
												  æ 
												  The boat has left a stormy land, 

												    A stormy sea before her,-- 

												    When, O! too strong for human hand, 

												    The tempest gather'd o'er her. 
												  æ
												  And still they row'd amidst the roar 

												    Of waters fast prevailing: 

												    Lord Ullin reach'd that fatal shore,-- 

												    His wrath was changed to wailing. 
												  æ
												  For, sore dismay'd through storm and shade, 

												    His child he did discover:-- 

												    One lovely hand she stretch'd for aid, 

												    And one was round her lover. 
												  æ
												  "Come back! come back!'' he cried in grief 

												    "Across this stormy water: 

												    And I'll forgive your Highland chief, 

												    My daughter!--O my daughter!'' 
												  æ
												  'Twas vain: the loud waves lash'd the shore, 

												    Return or aid preventing: 

												    The waters wild went o'er his child, 

											    And he was left lamenting.



Love Poems

#######################################################

You seemed a caryatid melting

												    Into the wind-blown, dark blue temple of the sky.

												    But you bent down as I came closer, breaking the image.

												    When I passed, you raised your head

												    And blew the little feather of a smile upon me.

												    I caught it on open lips and blew it back.

												    And in that moment we loved,

												    Although you stood still waiting for your lover,

											      And I walked on to my love.



Love Poems

#######################################################

Lying asleep between the strokes of night

												    I saw my love lean over my sad bed,

												    Pale as the duskiest lily's leaf or head,

												    Smooth-skinned and dark, with bare throat made to bite,

												    Too wan for blushing and too warm for white,

												    But perfect-coloured without white or red.

												    And her lips opened amorously, and said--

											      I wist not what, saving one word--Delight.
												  æ
												  And all her face was honey to my mouth,

												    And all her body pasture to my eyes;

												    The long lithe arms and hotter hands than fire,

												    The quivering flanks, hair smelling of the south,

												    The bright light feet, the splendid supple thighs

											    And glittering eyelids of my soul's desire.



Dream Poems

In this dream. 
												  æ
                                                You are a painting by Thomas Hart Benton with luxurious black hair and beautiful pale white skin 
                                                æ
										        Asleep. 
										        æ
										        An old hillbilly a mid-west aging Pluto attempts to touch you, looks at you from around the corner in awe and sublime wonder and its obvious and plain to see that he is complete and completely in love with you as you lie in a Cinderella-like ecstasy naked in the middle of a rural Kansas field. Persephone he is softly saying, Persephone. But you cannot hear him speak and he cannot bear to take you into the underground of his place, and his hell. In the background there is a wheat thresher and FDR's America, there is a wide open blue & empty sky full of white clouds and depression era beliefs, and you are Beautiful he murmurs Beautiful because Cupid has overtaken him and you have overtaken all his senses and he cannot ever leave. 
										        æ
										        So in this dream. äó_. you are a painting 
										        æ
												  In this dream you are the spring and the awakening of all ancient wonders and all ancient things, hidden away among the fears and jealousies of all men who cannot see 
												  æ
										        The very things that makes you beautiful 
										        æ
											    äóìYouäó



Ocean Poems

#######################################################

These wet rocks where the tide has been,

												    Barnacled white and weeded brown

												    And slimed beneath to a beautiful green,

												    These wet rocks where the tide went down

												    Will show again when the tide is high

												    Faint and perilous, far from shore,

												    No place to dream, but a place to die--

												    The bottom of the sea once more.

												    There was a child that wandered through

												    A giant's empty house all day--

												    House full of wonderful things and new,

											      But no fit place for a child to play.



Love

#######################################################

I went to the dances at Chandlerville,
And played snap-out at Winchester.
One time we changed partners,
Driving home in the moonlight of middle June,
And then I found Davis.
We were married and lived together for seventy years,
Enjoying, working, raising the twelve children,
Eight of whom we lost
Ere I had reached the age of sixty.
I spun, I wove, I kept the house, I nursed the sick,
I made the garden, and for holiday
Rambled over the fields where sang the larks,
And by Spoon River gathering many a shell,
And many a flower and medicinal weed 
Shouting to the wooded hills, singing to the green valleys.
At ninety-six I had lived enough, that is all,
And passed to a sweet repose.
What is this I hear of sorrow and weariness,
Anger, discontent and drooping hopes?
Degenerate sons and daughters,
Life is too strong for you 
It takes life to love Life.



Narrative Poems

#######################################################

MAUD MULLER, on a summer's day, 

												    Raked the meadows sweet with hay. 

                                                    

												    Beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth 

												    Of simple beauty and rustic health. 

                                                    

												    Singing, she wrought, and her merry glee 

												    The mock-bird echoed from his tree. 

                                                    

												    But, when she glanced to the far-off town, 

												    White from its hill-slope looking down, 

                                                    

												    The sweet song died, and a vague unrest 

												    And a nameless longing filled her breast-- 

                                                    

												    A wish, that she hardly dared to own, 

												    For something better than she had known. 

                                                    

												    The Judge rode slowly down the lane, 

												    Smoothing his horse's chestnut mane. 

                                                    

												    He drew his bridle in the shade 

												    Of the apple-trees, to greet the maid, 

                                                    

												    And ask a draught from the spring that flowed 

												    Through the meadow across the road. 

                                                    

												    She stooped where the cool spring bubbled up, 

												    And filled for him her small tin cup, 

                                                    

												    And blushed as she gave it, looking down 

												    On her feet so bare, and her tattered gown. 

                                                    

"Thanks!" said the Judge, "a sweeter draught 

From a fairer hand was never quaffed." 

                                                    

												    He spoke of the grass and flowers and trees, 

												    Of the singing birds and the humming bees; 

                                                    

												    Then talked of the haying, and wondered whether 

												    The cloud in the west would bring foul weather. 

                                                    

												    And Maud forgot her briar-torn gown, 

												    And her graceful ankles bare and brown; 

                                                    

												    And listened, while a pleasant surprise 

												    Looked from her long-lashed hazel eyes. 

                                                    

												    At last, like one who for delay 

												    Seeks a vain excuse, he rode away, 

                                                    

                                                    Maud Muller looked and sighed: "Ah, me! 

												    That I the Judge's bride might be! 

                                                    

"He would dress me up in silks so fine, 

												    And praise and toast me at his wine. 

                                                    

"My father should wear a broadcloth coat; 

												    My brother should sail a painted boat. 

                                                    

"I'd dress my mother so grand and gay, 

												    And the baby should have a new toy each day. 

                                                    

"And I'd feed the hungry and clothe the poor, 

And all should bless me who left our door." 

                                                    

												    The Judge looked back as he climbed the hill, 

												    And saw Maud Muller standing still. 

                                                    

"A form more fair, a face more sweet, 

												    Ne'er hath it been my lot to meet. 

                                                    

"And her modest answer and graceful air 

												    Show her wise and good as she is fair. 

                                                    

"Would she were mine, and I to-day, 

												    Like her, a harvester of hay: 

                                                    

"No doubtful balance of rights and wrongs, 

												    Nor weary lawyers with endless tongues, 

                                                    

"But low of cattle, and song of birds, 

And health, and quiet, and loving words." 

                                                    

												    But he thought of his sisters, proud and cold, 

												    And his mother, vain of her rank and gold. 

                                                    

												    So, closing his heart, the Judge rode on, 

												    And Maud was left in the field alone. 

                                                    

												    But the lawyers smiled that afternoon, 

												    When he hummed in court an old love-tune; 

                                                    

												    And the young girl mused beside the well, 

												    Till the rain on the unraked clover fell. 

                                                    

												    He wedded a wife of richest dower, 

												    Who lived for fashion, as he for power. 

                                                    

												    Yet oft, in his marble hearth's bright glow, 

												    He watched a picture come and go: 

                                                    

												    And sweet Maud Muller's hazel eyes 

												    Looked out in their innocent surprise. 

                                                    

												    Oft when the wine in his glass was red, 

												    He longed for the wayside well instead; 

                                                    

												    And closed his eyes on his garnished rooms, 

												    To dream of meadows and clover-blooms. 

                                                    

												    And the proud man sighed, with a secret pain, 

"Ah, that I were free again! 

                                                    

"Free as when I rode that day, 

Where the barefoot maiden raked her hay." 

                                                    

												    She wedded a man unlearned and poor, 

												    And many children played round her door. 

                                                    

												    But care and sorrow, and child-birth pain, 

												    Left their traces on heart and brain. 

                                                    

												    And oft, when the summer sun shone hot 

												    On the new-mown hay in the meadow lot, 

                                                    

												    And she heard the little spring brook fall 

												    Over the roadside, through the wall, 

                                                    

												    In the shade of the apple-tree again 

												    She saw a rider draw his rein, 

                                                    

												    And, gazing down with timid grace, 

												    She felt his pleased eyes read her face. 

                                                    

												    Sometimes her narrow kitchen walls 

												    Stretched away into stately halls; 

                                                    

												    The weary wheel to a spinnet turned, 

												    The tallow candle an astral burned; 

                                                    

												    And for him who sat by the chimney lug, 

												    Dozing and grumbling o'er pipe and mug, 

                                                    

												    A manly form at her side she saw, 

												    And joy was duty and love was law. 

                                                    

												    Then she took up her burden of life again, 

												    Saying only, "It might have been." 

                                                    

												    Alas for maiden, alas for Judge, 

												    For rich repiner and household drudge! 

                                                    

												    God pity them both! and pity us all, 

												    Who vainly the dreams of youth recall; 

                                                    

												    For of all sad words of tongue or pen, 

												    The saddest are these: "It might have been!" 

                                                    

												    Ah, well! for us all some sweet hope lies 

												    Deeply buried from human eyes; 

                                                    

												    And, in the hereafter, angels may 

											      Roll the stone from its grave away!



Old Age Poems

#######################################################

Friend, your white beard sweeps the ground.

												    Why do you stand, expectant?

												    Do you hope to see it

												    In one of your withered days?

												    With your old eyes

												    Do you hope to see

												    The triumphal march of Justice?

												    Do not wait, friend!

												    Take your white beard

												    And your old eyes

											      To more tender lands.



Death Poems

#######################################################

Iäó»ll love you both before and after death.

												    She rots like a November blackberry.

												    The churchyardäó»s ruined but heäó»s in no hurry,

											    he gives hours to her because sheäó»s barely drawing breath.
												  æ
												  Still she desires him passionately and pleasure makes him gruff,

												    his coat protects her from the cold, the sharp rain flurry:

												    Iäó»ll love you both before and after death.

											    She rots like a November blackberry.
												  æ
												  Her carpet is rotted poplar leaves, her flowers are thistle fluff

												    umbels of parchment, one red leaf left on a tree:

											    he kisses and drinks her tears, tears make her ghostly
												  æ
										        she suffers in the shine of sunset, suffers both gnats and moths:
										        æ
											    Iäó»ll love you both before and after death.



Love Poems

#######################################################

He belongs to her,

												    like a tongue to its mouth,

												    and the soft lips on her skull

												    seek him out,

												    as do the soft lips 

											    on the bony mount.
												  æ
												  He came this way

												    and forever changed the shape

												    of the ether in her rooms,

												    opened up the window 

											    in the ceiling to her sky.
												  æ
												  He held a cluster,

												    a loose cascade of rubies,

												    blue sapphires 

												    and a solitary diamond

											    in his palm.
												  æ
										        And while he spoke the words,

												    poem of his heart,

												    so she would know at last

												    with the forefront of her mind,

												    and cease forgetting,

												    he hung the gently sparkling stones

												    from every point in the space

												    wherein they stood.
										        æ
											    Then he looked up,

												    silent, his smile trembling,

												    and watched her face

												    as she realised who he was,

												    what he had done.

												    For she belongs to him

												    like a mouth belongs

												    to its tongue.



Night Poems

#######################################################

If night was a silent killer

												    or a final sleepin pill

												    painless

												    it would have been easy

												    it would have been sudden

											      it would have been sad.
												  æ
								                If night was a vampire hanging upside down from the branch of a burnt tree

												    it would have been ghastly and fearful.
								                æ
											    But night is a blue mystery in her eyes

												    and night is a million echoes from other worlds

												    and it is understandably incomprehensable

												    and it is joyfully like the existence of lost love in the drops of rain.



Night Poems

#######################################################

Below us, the city

												    dreams an illusory path

												    drawn from the watery tints

											      of the mind's paint box.
												  æ
												  Up here,

												    darkness and madness

												    spill out around us

												    through all the dead

												    ends and U-turns,

												    the debris of our lives.
												  æ
												  Should we give up

												    and let the teeth sink in?

												    How far gone are you?
												  æ
								                Should we drive back

												    down or straight off

												    the edge of the world?
								                æ
											    I rev up the engine

												    and head for oblivion.



Nature

#######################################################

I have built a house in the middle of the Ocean
Its windows are the rivers flowing from my eyes
Octopi are crawling all over where the walls are
Hear their triple hearts beat and their beaks peck against the windowpanes

House of dampness
House of burning
Seasons fastness
Season singing
The airplanes are laying eggs
Watch out for the dropping of the anchor

Watch out for the shooting black ichor
It would be good if you were to come from the sky
The skys honeysuckle is climbing
The earthly octopi are throbbing
And so very many of us have become our own gravediggers
Pale octopi of the chalky waves O octopi with pale beaks
Around the house is this ocean that you know well
  And is never still


Translated from the French 



War Poems

#######################################################

Oh stay at home, my lad, and plough

												    The land and not the sea,

												    And leave the soldiers at their drill,

												    And all about the idle hill

											      Shepherd your sheep with me.
												  æ
										        Oh stay with company and mirth

												    And daylight and the air;

												    Too full already is the grave

												    Of fellows that were good and brave

												    And died because they were.



Old Age Poems

#######################################################

The park bench's were filled

												    with all the local old men.

												    They sat and pondered and relived

												    forgotten dreams once again.

												    In faded trousers and plaid

												    shirts they came,

												    tired and worn,

												    common in their fame,

												    each one the others only

												    remaining friend.

												    Life starts out as a newborn baby

											      and slowly becomes old men.



Love Poems

#######################################################

The moon is a hard white rock

												    disenchanting

												    These many months my

												    lover has withdrawn her

Mythological Poems

I RECOGNIZED him by his skips and hops,

												    And by his hair I knew that he was Pan.

												    Through sunny avenues he ran,

												    And leapt for cherries to the red tree-tops.

												    Upon his fleece were pearling water drops

											      Like little silver stars. How pure he was!
												  æ
												  And this was when my spring was arched with blue.
												  æ
												  Now, seeing a cherry of a smoother gloss,

												    He seized it, and bit the kernel from the pulp.

												    I watched him with great joy ... I came anigh ...

												    He spat the kernel straight into my eye.

												    I ran to kill Pan with my knife!

												    He stretched his arm out, swirled--

												    And the whole earth whirled!
												  æ
												  Let us adore Pan, god of all the world!

Just where the Treasury's marble front

												    Looks over Wall Street's mingled nations;

												    Where Jews and Gentiles most are wont

												    To throng for trade and last quotations;

												    Where, hour by hour, the rates of gold

												    Outrival, in the ears of people,

												    The quarter-chimes, serenely tolled

											      From Trinity's undaunted steeple, -
												  æ
												  Even there I heard a strange, wild strain

												    Sound high above the modern clamor,

												    Above the cries of greed and gain,

												    The curbstone war, the auction's hammer;

												    And swift, on Music's misty ways,

												    It led, from all this strife for millions,

												    To ancient, sweet-to-nothing days

												    Among the kirtle-robed Sicilians.
												  æ
												  And as it stilled the multitude,

												    And yet more joyous rose, and shriller,

												    I saw the minstrel, where he stood

												    At ease against a Doric pillar:

												    One hand a droning organ played,

												    The other held a Pan's-pipe (fashioned

												    Like those of old) to lips that made

												    The reeds give out that strain impassioned.
												  æ
												  'Twas Pan himself had wandered here

												    A-strolling through this sordid city,

												    And piping to the civic ear

												    The prelude of some pastoral ditty!

												    The demigod had crossed the seas, -

												    From haunts of shepherd, nymph, and satyr,

												    And Syracusan times, - to these

												    Far shores and twenty centuries later.
												  æ
												  A ragged cap was on his head;

												    But - hidden thus - there was no doubting

												    That, all with crispy locks o'erspread,

												    His gnarled horns were somewhere sprouting;

												    His club-feet, cased in rusty shoes,

												    Were crossed, as on some frieze you see them,

												    And trousers, patched of divers hues,

												    Concealed his crooked shanks beneath them.
												  æ
												  He filled the quivering reeds with sound,

												    And o'er his mouth their changes shifted,

												    And with his goat's-eyes looked around

												    Where'er the passing current drifted;

												    And soon, as on Trinacrian hills

												    The nymphs and herdsmen ran to hear him,

												    Even now the tradesmen from their tills,

												    With clerks and porters, crowded near him.
												  æ
												  The bulls and bears together drew

												    From Jauncey Court and New Street Alley,

												    As erst, if pastorals be true,

												    Came beasts from every wooded valley;

												    The random passers stayed to list, -

												    A boxer Aegon, rough and merry,

												    A Broadway Daphnis, on his tryst 

												    With Nais at the Brooklyn Ferry.
												  æ
												  A one-eyed Cyclops halted long

												    In tattered cloak of army pattern,

												    And Galatea joined the throng, -

												    A blowsy, apple-vending slattern;

												    While old Silenus staggered out

												    From some new-fangled lunch-house handy,

												    And bade the piper, with a shout,

												    To strike up Yankee Doodle Dandy!
												  æ
												  A newsboy and a peanut-girl

												    Like little Fauns began to caper:

												    His hair was all in tangled curl,

												    Her tawny legs were bare and taper;

												    And still the gathering larger grew,

												    And gave its pence and crowded nigher,

												    While aye the shepherd-minstrel blew

												    His pipe, and struck the gamut higher.
												  æ
												  O heart of Nature, beating still

												    With throbs her vernal passion taught her, -

												    Even here, as on the vine-clad hill,

												    Or by the Arethusan water!

												    New forms may fold the speech, new lands

												    Arise within these ocean-portals,

												    But Music waves eternal wands, -

												    Enchantress of the souls of mortals!
												  æ
												  So thought I, - but among us trod

												    A man in blue, with legal baton,

												    And scoffed the vagrant demigod,

												    And pushed him from the step I sat on.

												    Doubting I mused upon the cry,

												    "Great Pan is dead!" - and all the people

												    Went on their ways: - and clear and high

											    The quarter sounded from the steeple.



Love

Lying in dug-outs, joking idly, wearily;
   Watching the candle guttering in the draught;
Hearing the great shells go high over us, eerily
   Singing; how often have I turned over, and laughed
 
With pity and pride, photographs of all colours,
   All sizes, subjects: khaki brothers in France;
Or mother's faces worn with countless dolours;
   Or girls whose eyes were challenging and must dance,
 
Though in a picture only, a common cheap
   Ill-taken card; and childrenfrozen, some
(Babies) waiting on Dicky-bird to peep
   Out of the handkerchief that is his home
 
(But he's so shy!). And some with bright looks, calling
   Delight across the miles of land and sea,
That not the dread of barrage suddenly falling
   Could quite blot outnot mud nor lethargy.
 
Smiles and triumphant careless laughter. O
   The pain of them, wide Earth's most sacred things! 
Lying in dug-outs, hearing the great shells slow
   Sailing mile-high, the heart mounts higher and sings.
 
But onceO why did he keep that bitter token
   Of a dead Love?that boy, who, suddenly moved,
Showed me, his eyes wet, his low talk broken,
   A girl who better had not been beloved.



Love Poems

An old silver church in a forest

Is my love for you

The trees around it

Are words that I have stolen from your heart.

An old silver bell, the last smile you gave,

Hangs at the top of my church.

It rings only when you come through the forest

And stand beside it.

And then, it has no need for ringing,

For your voice takes its place.

Wandering oversea dreamer,

												    And the star in the north,

I
										        
												  Looking seaward, o'er the sand-hills stands the fortress, old and quaint,

											    By the San Francisco friars lifted to their patron saint--
												  æ
												  Sponsor to that wondrous city, now apostate to the creed,

											    On whose youthful walls the Padre saw the angel's golden reed;
												  æ
												  All its trophies long since scattered, all its blazon brushed away,

											    And the flag that flies above it but a triumph of today.
												  æ
												  Never scar of siege or battle challenges the wandering eye--

											    Never breach of warlike onset holds the curious passerby;
												  æ
												  Only one sweet human fancy interweaves its threads of gold

											    With the plain and homespun present, and a love that ne'er grows old;
												  æ
												  Only one thing holds its crumbling walls above the meaner dust--

											    Listen to the simple story of a woman's love and trust.
												  
												    II
										        
												  Count von Resanoff, the Russian, envoy of the mighty Czar,

											    Stood beside the deep embrasures where the brazen cannon are.
												  æ
												  He with grave provincial magnates long had held serene debate

											    On the Treaty of Alliance and the high affairs of state;
												  æ
												  He, from grave provincial magnates, oft had turned to talk apart

											    With the Commandante's daughter, on the questions of the heart,
												  æ
												  Until points of gravest import yielded slowly, one by one,

											    And by Love was consummated what Diplomacy begun;
												  æ
												  Till beside the deep embrasures, where the brazen cannon are,

											    He received the twofold contract for approval of the Czar;
												  æ
												  Till beside the brazen cannon the betrothíÂd bade adieu,

											    And, from sally-port and gateway, north the Russian eagles flew.
												  
												    III
										        
												  Long beside the deep embrasures, where the brazen cannon are,

											    Did they wait the promised bridegroom and the answer of the Czar;
												  æ
												  Day by day on wall and bastion beat the hollow empty breeze--

											    Day by day the sunlight glittered on the vacant, smiling seas;
												  æ
												  Week by week the near hills whitened in their dusty leather cloaks--

											    Week by week the far hills darkened from the fringing plain of oaks;
												  æ
												  Till the rains came, and far-breaking, on the fierce southwester tossed,

											    Dashed the whole long coast with color, and then vanished and were lost.
												  æ
												  So each year the seasons shifted; wet and warm and drear and dry;

											    Half a year of clouds and flowers--half a year of dust and sky.
												  æ
												  Still it brought no ship or message--brought no tiding ill nor meet

											    For the statesmanlike Commander, for the daughter fair and sweet.
												  æ
												  Yet she heard the varying message, voiceless to all ears beside:

											    "He will come," the flowers whispered; "Come no more," the dry hills sighed.
												  æ
												  Still she found him with the waters lifted by the morning breeze--

											    Still she lost him with the folding of the great white-tented seas;
												  æ
												  Until hollows chased the dimples from her cheeks of olive brown,

											    And at times a swift, shy moisture dragged the long sweet lashes down;
												  æ
												  Or the small mouth curved and quivered as for some denied caress,

											    And the fair young brow was knitted in an infantine distress.
												  æ
												  Then the grim Commander, pacing where the brazen cannon are,

											    Comforted the maid with proverbs--wisdom gathered from afar;
												  æ
												  Bits of ancient observation by his fathers garnered, each

											    As a pebble worn and polished in the current of his speech:
												  æ
												  "'Those who wait the coming rider travel twice as far as he';

											    'Tired wench and coming butter never did in time agree.'
												  æ
												  "'He that getteth himself honey, though a clown, he shall have flies';

											    'In the end God grinds the miller'; 'In the dark the mole has eyes.'
												  æ
												  "'He whose father is Alcalde, of his trial hath no fear,'--

											    And be sure the Count has reasons that will make his conduct clear."
												  æ
												  Then the voice sententious faltered, and the wisdom it would teach

											    Lost itself in fondest trifles of his soft Castilian speech;
												  æ
												  And on "Concha," "Conchitita," and "Conchita" he would dwell

											    With the fond reiteration which the Spaniard knows so well.
												  æ
												  So with proverbs and caresses, half in faith and half in doubt,

											    Every day some hope was kindled, flickered, faded, and went out.
												  
												    IV
										        
												  Yearly, down the hillside sweeping, came the stately cavalcade,

											    Bringing revel to vaquero, joy and comfort to each maid;
												  æ
												  Bringing days of formal visit, social feast and rustic sport;

											    Of bull-baiting on the plaza, of love-making in the court.
												  æ
												  Vainly then at Concha's lattice--vainly as the idle wind

											    Rose the thin high Spanish tenor that bespoke the youth too kind;
												  æ
												  Vainly, leaning from their saddles, caballeros, bold and fleet,

											    Plucked for her the buried chicken from beneath their mustang's feet;
												  æ
												  So in vain the barren hillsides with their gay serapes blazed,

											    Blazed and vanished in the dust-cloud that their flying hoofs had raised.
												  æ
												  Then the drum called from the rampart, and once more with patient mien

											    The Commander and his daughter each took up the dull routine--
												  æ
												  Each took up the petty duties of a life apart and lone,

											    Till the slow years wrought a music in its dreary monotone.
												  
												    V
										        
												  Forty years on wall and bastion swept the hollow idle breeze,

											    Since the Russian eagle fluttered from the California seas.
												  æ
												  Forty years on wall and bastion wrought its slow but sure decay;

											    And St. George's cross was lifted in the port of Monterey.
												  æ
												  And the citadel was lighted, and the hall was gayly dressed,

											    All to honor Sir George Simpson, famous traveller and guest.
												  æ
												  Far and near the people gathered to the costly banquet set,

											    And exchanged congratulation with the English baronet;
												  æ
												  Till the formal speeches ended, and amidst the laugh and wine

											    Some one spoke of Concha's lover--heedless of the warning sign.
												  æ
												  Quickly then cried Sir George Simpson: "Speak no ill of him, I pray.

											    He is dead. He died, poor fellow, forty years ago this day.
												  æ
												  'Died while speeding home to Russia, falling from a fractious horse.

											    Left a sweetheart too, they tell me. Married, I suppose, of course!
												  æ
												  "Lives she yet?" A death-like silence fell on banquet, guests and hall,

											    And a trembling figure rising fixed the awe-struck gaze of all.
												  æ
										        Two black eyes in darkened orbits gleamed beneath the nun's white hood;

												    Black serge hid the wasted figure, bowed and stricken where it stood.
										        æ
											    "Lives she yet?" Sir George repeated. All were hushed as Concha drew

												    Closer yet her nun's attire. "Seí±or, pardon, she died too!"

Flower Poems

You write to me about roses,

												    About roses opening as roses die.

												    Always, you say, there are roses,

												    So that people get used to them

												    And cease to wonder.

												    Now I am on a hilltop,

												    Bare, with a few pine trees

												    Twisted by an inexhaustible wind,

												    By a wind that is never tired,

												    A wind that passes and passes and is never gone.

												    I cannot think what it would be like for the pine trees

											    If there were no wind.
												  æ
												  Your roses would not be happy on my hilltop.

												    They would be scornful of my huckleberry bushes

											    With their plain, blue fruit.
												  æ
										        They would not care for the white meadow-sweet

												    That leans against a rock.

												    Roses must have rich soil,

												    And careful pruning.

												    They must be sheltered from the wind and cold

												    And have stakes to lean upon.

												    They do not stand alone like the flames of vervain

												    On my windy hilltop.
										        æ
											    Roses are gifts for lovers.

												    Lovers have always had much to say about roses.

												    When you sent me a rose

												    Folded in a letter,

												    Did you know I would open it on a hilltop

												    Where the wind searches me

												    As it does the pine trees

												    And my skirts are brushing

												    The fine flame of the vervain?



Nature

#######################################################

When daisies pied and violets blue
      And lady-smocks all silver-white
And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
      Do paint the meadows with delight,
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men; for thus sings he: 
                                                    Cuckoo;
Cuckoo, cuckoo! O, word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear!

When shepherds pipe on oaten straws,
      And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
      And maidens bleach their summer smocks,
The cuckoo then, on every tree,
Mocks married men; for thus sings he,
                                                    Cuckoo;
Cuckoo, cuckoo! O, word of fear,
Unpleasing to a married ear!

When icicles hang by the wall,
      And Dick the shepherd blows his nail,
And Tom bears logs into the hall,
      And milk comes frozen home in pail,
When blood is nipp'd, and ways be foul,
Then nightly sings the staring-owl,
                                                    Tu-who;
Tu-whit, tu-who!a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.

When all aloud the wind doth blow,
      And coughing drowns the parson's saw,
And birds sit brooding in the snow,
      And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
Then nightly sings the staring owl,
                                                    Tu-who;
Tu-whit, tu-who!a merry note,
While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.

Where the bee sucks, there suck I:
In a cowslips bell I lie;
There I couch when owls do cry.
On the bats back I do fly
After summer merrily.   
Merrily, merrily shall I live now
Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.



Spring Poems

#######################################################

NOW hand in hand, you little maidens, walk.

												    Pass in the shadow of the crumbling wall.

												    Arch your proud bellies under rosy aprons.

												    And let your eyes so deeply lucid tell

												    Your joy at feeling flowing into your heart

												    Another loving heart that blends with yours;

											      You children faint with being hand in hand.
												  æ
												  Walk hand in hand, you languorous maidens walk.

												    The boys are turning round, and drinking in

												    Your sensual petticoats that beat your heels.

												    And, while you swing your interlacing hands,

												    Tell, with your warm mouths yearning each to each,

												    The first books you have read, and your first kisses.

												    Walk hand in hand, you maidens, friend with friend.
												  æ
												  Walk hand in hand, you lovers loving silence.

												    Walk to the sun that veils itself with willows.

												    Trail your uneasy limbs by languorous banks,

												    The stream is full of dusk, your souls are heavy.

												    You silent lovers, wander hand in hand.



War Poems

#######################################################

Halted against the shade of a last hill,

												    They fed, and, lying easy, were at ease

												    And, finding comfortable chests and knees

												    Carelessly slept. But many there stood still 

												    To face the stark, blank sky beyond the ridge,

												    Knowing their feet had come to the end of the world.
											    æ
												  Marvelling they stood, and watched the long grass swirled

												    By the May breeze, murmurous with wasp and midge,

												    For though the summer oozed into their veins

												    Like the injected drug for their bones' pains,

												    Sharp on their souls hung the imminent line of grass,

												    Fearfully flashed the sky's mysterious glass.
											    æ
												  Hour after hour they ponder the warm field--

												    And the far valley behind, where the buttercups

												    Had blessed with gold their slow boots coming up,

												    Where even the little brambles would not yield,

												    But clutched and clung to them like sorrowing hands;

												    They breathe like trees unstirred.
											    æ
												  Till like a cold gust thrilled the little word

												    At which each body and its soul begird

												    And tighten them for battle. No alarms

												    Of bugles, no high flags, no clamorous haste--

												    Only a lift and flare of eyes that faced

												    The sun, like a friend with whom their love is done.

												    O larger shone that smile against the sun,--

												    Mightier than his whose bounty these have spurned.
											    æ
												  So, soon they topped the hill, and raced together

												    Over an open stretch of herb and heather

												    Exposed. And instantly the whole sky burned

												    With fury against them; and soft sudden cups

												    Opened in thousands for their blood; and the green slopes

												    Chasmed and steepened sheer to infinite space.
											    æ
												  Of them who running on that last high place

												    Leapt to swift unseen bullets, or went up

												    On the hot blast and fury of hell's upsurge,

												    Or plunged and fell away past this world's verge,

												    Some say God caught them even before they fell.
												  æ
												  But what say such as from existence' brink

												    Ventured but drave too swift to sink.

												    The few who rushed in the body to enter hell,

												    And there out-fiending all its fiends and flames

												    With superhuman inhumanities,

												    Long-famous glories, immemorial shames--

												    And crawling slowly back, have by degrees

												    Regained cool peaceful air in wonder--

												    Why speak they not of comrades that went under?



Snow Poems

#######################################################

WHOSE woods these are I think I know.

												    His house is in the village though;

												    He will not see me stopping here

											      To watch his woods fill up with snow.
												  æ
												  My little horse must think it queer

												    To stop without a farmhouse near

												    Between the woods and frozen lake

												    The darkest evening of the year.
												  æ
												  He gives his harness bells a shake

												    To ask if there is some mistake.

												    The only other sound's the sweep

												    Of easy wind and downy flake.
												  æ
												  The woods are lovely, dark and deep.

												    But I have promises to keep,

												    And miles to go before I sleep,

											    And miles to go before I sleep.

Surgeons must be very careful

War Poems

#######################################################

Beings have molten forms and lives together.
											    
												  THE sunshine cannot make the barracks glad.

												    Its seeming happiness is real pain;

												    The building faces to the East; anigh

												    Its girdle, forests, fields, and gardens lie;

												    Then the horizon furbished by the dawn.
												  æ
												  The whitewashed parget walls seem to receive

												    Only the purest rays that light contains.

												    The red tiles give the roof a youthful look,

												    The sanded court is opened like a flower.
												  æ
												  And yet the handsome building is in pain.
												  æ
												  The clock has just struck eight. This is the hour

												    When, in the mighty cities far away,

												    A rustling of glad bodies fills the morn,

												    Of men that from the girdle inwards crowd,

												    Scattered no more by isolating sleep.

												    A fluid multitude swells streets like veins,

												    And enters into offices and works.
												  æ
												  Shop-windows glass the haste of passers-by;

												    The omnibuses grate, the chimneys smoke;

												    Men are connected by chaotic rhythms,

												    Keen groups are born, and swarm, and are transformed.

												    Awakened muscles willingly are strong,

												    Life pours as from a bent, full bottle's neck.
												  æ
												  The barracks suffer, wishing back the night.

												    The soldiers fain would sleep into the dawn,

												    To be themselves still longer in the dark,

												    Nestling their liberty in crinkled sheets.
												  æ
												  The clarion's panting cries compel the barracks

												    Once more to don its single, dolorous soul.

												    Giving to arms no time to stretch themselves,

												    To hearts no time to glide out of their dreams,

												    The barracks sets its forces galloping,

												    And whips at sluggish flanks that hate the lash.

												    Rest, silence, and the friendship of the dark,

												    Are with a single impulse thrust outside,

												    for these impurities would weigh down limbs

												    Which may not have, until the day is done,

												    One nerve inactive nor one muscle lax.

												    The barracks hurries, but the hours are sacks

												    Too narrow, from too supple leather cut

												    To hold the heap of movements and of acts

												    With which it seeks to stuff them, out of breath.
												  æ
												  Behind the walls

												    The vegetating fields lie pensively.

												    The plants, sure they have time, by slow degrees

												    Work out their shape, and in themselves unite

												    The joy of being spreading like a lake,

												    The joy of growing flowing like a river.

												    And every time the barracks gazes thither,

												    It bustles less and feels it is in pain.
												  æ
												  Bent soldiers scrub the wooden floors of rooms;

												    Their backs will have lumbago, arms the cramps.

												    One was a farm-hand, and remembers now

												    The music of the scythe in grass of June.

												    This fair-haired fellow, panting down the stairs,

												    Is thinking of a little Town-Hall office

												    With windows o'er a yellow, dozing square;

												    He used to sit in a cane-bottomed chair,

												    With glossy paper round his pen, that threw

												    Upon the left a fibre of blue shadow.

												    Mud clots the corridors, for yesterday

												    Was rainy; those who sweep are wearied out;

												    Others that on the stairheads squat or stand

												    Are scraping boots while sweat is on their brows.
												  æ
												  The traveller who climbs a wooded hill,

												    And, with his foot upon the highest stone,

												    Upon it pedestals his lonely frame,

												    to see the forest and to breathe its breath,

												    Resumes, for one grave second, in himself

												    The sap, the sprouting, and the scent of trees;

												    And if, in all the underwood, one twig

												    Rises above its clog and sharply cracks;

												    If strawberries ripen, sheltered by a bush,

												    One whiff of odour, and one flake of sound

												    Lost in the smell and rustling of the trees,

												    Run to the traveller's wide-opened brain

												    Wherein collected all the forest thinks.
												  æ
												  Thus raised more high than any peak of souls,

												    With effort freed from the entanglement

												    Wherein its branching passions cross and toss,

												    And covered with unconsciousness, this dew

												    Which dropped above the barracks when it passed

												    The dark, dense flesh that does not know itself,

												    Already vast but undecided still,

												    The conscience of the barracks,

												    From hearts dissimulated among things

												    Receives the feeble breath their essence scents,

												    And bids the little greifs sent up by men

												    Be seated in a corner of its grief,

												    That they may say in two words what they are,

												    And what complaints they bear.
												  æ
												  This conscience probes the tender epidermis,

												    Yea, and the final folds of human matter,

												    Even as a hand that warms and fills a glove.

												    And, timidly, in places, sees the chiefs

												    Like scattered seeds of lead within itself.
												  æ
												  And then it hears no longer little griefs.

												    A great wind drowns their wearisome falsetto;

												    The ardent sex of men begins to cry;

												    Desire of males in cage calls out for females;

												    The soldiers sing, roar, jostle, violate

												    The air. Their arms seek softer arms to knead.

												    Furious at having nothing to embrace

												    Save other stiffened arms that do not yield,

												    Furious at never finding anywhere

												    The soft white bodies that are needed for

												    The barracks to be soothed and have its flesh

												    In couples equilibrated, they kindle

												    A fire of frenzied gestures, and their kisses,

												    Waste cartridges cast in the flame, explode.
												  æ
												  And now a locomotive far away

												    Buries a whistle in the womb of space.

												    It is rebellion's signal; the clear order

												    The strength of trains darts unto men's, that they

												    May break the threads which make them gravitate

												    Round the same motionless and hated centre,

												    And from the turning sling escape, and pierce

												    Their duty like the paper in a hoop,

												    And the vast soaring rolled in them unfold,

												    And go away,

												    And o'er the horizon find their own horizon.
												  æ
												  Fain were the barracks to dissolve and die.

												    There is a breath glides through the soldiers' bodies,

												    Moving, disjoining, elevating them.

												    The enormous block seems porous. All its lives

												    From one another's hold tear to depart.

												    It was a serried fleet of sailing-ships;

												    But the wind whips them and the masts have cracked,

												    The ships are scattered broad-cast on the sea.
												  æ
												  O to set out! The soldiers stamp to go.

												    Their hope, tiptoe with expectation, tries

												    To see beforehand the miraculous hour

												    When all compulsion shall be reaped like hay.

												    And rude hands weigh the future, feel the months,

												    And count the days. And on partitions they

												    In trembling numbers carve how many more.
												  æ
												  By all its men the barracks fain would die.
												  æ
												  O this were death delicious as pure water,

												    If one could be dissolved, and pulverised,

												    And hurled in ruins by self-hate, without

												    One atom weeping the dead unity,

												    And not one being clinging to the warmth

												    Of living in the rhythm of the whole,

												    Without the unity bewailing its conscience,

												    O beautiful death!
												  æ
												  But not in this way shall the barracks die.

												    First in its leaded coffin it must live.

												    The State decrees it must exist, endure!

												    Feeds it with dole of food from day to day,

												    And fills it yearly with new sap of youth.
												  
												    Then, one morning, war.
												    æ
												    The barracks, that knows nothing,

												      Shall nothing know. It will be told

												      To glide out of its walls,

												      To march, to follow a road,

												      To get inside a black train.
												    æ
												    And later, not much later,

												      Not knowing where the carriages

												      Have taken it to;

												      Knowing nothing of all, except

												      That it must kill;

												      Lying flat on its belly,

												      Leaping like a grasshopper,

												      Wishing to live now with a frenzied wish,

												      In mud, and smoke, and din,

												      Bleeding, raging, thinned,

												      It will go and will be killed

												      By canons.
											    
												  And this presentiment makes weapons shine;

												    It spreads a gloss of phosphorus over them;

												    The muskets reared in line shine with it so

												    The soldiers have not for them that kind look

												    With which you soothe the back of things familiar,

												    But cast them glances grating on the steel.

												    The barracks sees that it is filled choke-full

											      Of muskets, bayonets, and cartridges.
												  æ
												  There are erected muskets in the racks,

												    And in the cellars and the garrets too.

												    All this swarms germinating in the barracks;

												    This is the seed! The barracks knows her sex.

												    She is prolific. And she carries, like

												    A heavy ovary which throbs and swells,

												    Millions of future deaths within her womb.
												  æ
												  The trains may whistle. What if she forget!

												    She has her flesh and her fatality.

											    Fated she is to kill and to be killed.

June 27, 1862.
												    æ
											        INSCRIBED TO THE GALLANT PENNSYLVANIA RESERVES.
										        
                                                The battle's last, long thunders rolled;

												    The witness-cloud to heaven was swept;

												    And night, the ghostly seer and old,

												    Around our blood-drenched borders crept:

											    Upon our arms we slept.
                                                æ
												  We slept: but night, that ancient seer,

												    Conned o'er us his prophetic lore;

												    And whispered low in many an ear,

												    "Thou art, but thou shalt be no more

											    When next the cannons roar."
												  æ
												  Sleep, that should lift the rugged cross

												    From staggering souls, but deepened pain,

												    With conscious sense of coming loss,

												    That like a wind preceding rain

											    Blew cold across the brain.
												  æ
												  But ah, the rain to come! No noise

												    Within our guarded limits ran;

												    But heavy hands shook slumber's poise,

												    And wearily, in rear and van,

											    Our dark retreat began.
												  æ
												  The stars, with crimson torches, sought

												    Their darkened pathways through the skies,

												    When woke our challenge-guns, and brought

												    From wary foemen's batteries

											    The boom of quick replies;
												  æ
												  As if fresh slaughter to prelude:

												    The while--by stratagem discreet--

												    Receding, pausing, scarce pursued,

												    With no disorder of defeat,

											    So moved our slow retreat.
												  æ
												  But when the sun his sword unsheathed,

												    And smote us sore, at bay we stood--

												    To God, the Just, our lives bequeathed;

												    Planted our guns by vale and wood,

											    To wait the rain of blood.
												  æ
												  It came! Full soon the war-fiend came--

												    Stern as hell's king, and fiery-browed!

												    We saw him smite, with hands of flame,

												    The solemn battle-harp and proud,

											    Where rose the sulphurous cloud.
												  æ
												  Behind our potent guns we stood--

												    Therefrom the awful war-bolts flew;

												    Bomb following bomb, full many a rood

												    They plowed the smoking woodlands through,

											    And what beside--God knew.
												  æ
												  We waited till the hour approved,

												    To hurl our forces undismayed,

												    Where Death in all his grandeur moved;

												    God's cause and Liberty's to aid

											    By bayonet, ball, or blade.
												  æ
												  There, fires that leap when patriots fall,

												    All startling sights that cowards shun;

												    All sounds that hurtle and appall--

												    The bursting shell, the roaring gun--

											    O'er all, the seething sun!
												  æ
												  Full closely swarmed the traitor horde;

												    Across the hill their bullets sang;

												    Along our yielding van they poured--

												    Their shouts like peals of victory rang--

											    Then, at the word, we sprang.
												  æ
												  Sweeping into the front we came;

												    Awhile along the hill-side bent,

												    Charged through the deep ravine, to claim

												    Its walls, for none but heroes meant--

											    God with us, as we went.
												  æ
												  Then did War's crashing music roll!

												    Then did the fire of battle-wrath

												    Rush hot through every loyal soul;

												    And where we swept, o'er all the path,

											    Was agony and scath.
												  æ
												  The leaden hail smote left and right;

												    The air was like a furnace red;

												    The sky was dizzy with the sight;

												    The sun was reeling overhead:

											    You could not count our dead.
												  æ
												  We saw their broken columns swerve;

												    They shook and faltered at the test;

												    New vigor shot through every nerve,

												    And hand to hand and breast to breast,

											    The glorious charge we pressed.
												  æ
												  We drove them from the gory banks--

												    Through forest-aisles their courses urged;

												    By field and wood their eddying ranks,

												    Like storm-tossed billows backward surged,

											    By Northern valor scourged.
												  
												    * * * * *
										        
												  The battle's last, long thunders rolled;

												    And down the vaulted skies, once more,

												    Came night, the ghostly seer and old,

												    To read fulfillment of his lore,

											    In streams of stiffening gore.
												  æ
												  And we, with weak and gasping breath,

												    With hearts that bled for comrades slain,

												    Reeled, shuddering, from the hill of death,

												    And laid us down to sleep again,

											    The soldier's sleep of pain.
												  æ
										        But every step upon the ground,

												    And every whisper stealing near,

												    Smote us anew with crashing sound,

												    As if the cannons rent the ear,

												    So loud the dead might hear.
										        æ
											    The stars their darkest pathways trod,

												    When we once more, with staggering feet,

												    Low whispering to ourselves and God,

												    "Only the sleep of death is sweet!"

												    Began our long retreat.



War Poems

#######################################################

Oh! wherefore come ye forth in triumph from the north, 

												    With your hands, and your feet, and your raiment all red? 

												    And wherefore doth your rout send forth a joyous shout? 

											      And whence be the grapes of the wine-press that ye tread? 
												  æ
												  Oh! evil was the root, and bitter was the fruit, 

												    And crimson was the juice of the vintage that we trod; 

												    For we trampled on the throng of the haughty and the strong, 

												    Who sate in the high places and slew the saints of God. 
												  æ
												  It was about the noon of a glorious day of June, 

												    That we saw their banners dance and their cuirasses shine, 

												    And the man of blood was there, with his long essenced hair, 

												    And Astley, and Sir Marmaduke, and Rupert of the Rhine. 
												  æ
												  Like a servant of the Lord, with his Bible and his sword, 

												    The general rode along us to form us for the fight; 

												    When a murmuring sound broke out, and swelled into a shout 

												    Among the godless horsemen upon the tyrant's right. 
												  æ
												  And hark! like the roar of the billows on the shore, 

												    The cry of battle rises along their charging line: 

												    For God! for the Cause! for the Church! for the laws! 

												    For Charles, king of England, and Rupert of the Rhine! 
												  æ
												  The furious German comes, with his clarions and his drums, 

												    His bravoes of Alsatia and pages of Whitehall; 

												    They are bursting on our flanks! Grasp your pikes! Close your ranks! 

												    For Rupert never comes, but to conquer or to fall. 
												  æ
												  They are here -- they rush on -- we are broken -- we are gone -- 

												    Our left is borne before them like stubble on the blast. 

												    O Lord, put forth thy might! O Lord, defend the right! 

												    Stand back to back, in God's name! and fight it to the last! 
												  æ
												  Stout Skippen hath a wound -- the centre hath given ground. 

												    Hark! Hark! what means the trampling of horsemen on our rear? 

												    Whose banner do I see, boys? 'Tis he! thank God! 'tis he, boys! 

												    Bear up another minute! Brave Oliver is here! 
												  æ
												  Their heads all stooping low, their points all in a row: 

												    Like a whirlwind on the trees, like a deluge on the dikes, 

												    Our cuirassiers have burst on the ranks of the accurst, 

												    And at a shock have scattered the forest of his pikes. 
												  æ
												  Fast, fast, the gallants ride, in some safe nook to hide 

												    Their coward heads, predestined to rot on Temple Bar; 

												    And he -- he turns! he flies! shame on those cruel eyes 

												    That bore to look on torture, and dare not look on war! 
												  æ
												  Ho, comrades! scour the plain; and ere ye strip the slain, 

												    First give another stab to make your search secure; 

												    Then shake from sleeves and pockets their broad-pieces and lockets, 

												    The tokens of the wanton, the plunder of the poor. 
												  æ
												  Fools! your doublets shone with gold, and your hearts were gay and bold, 

												    When you kissed your lily hands to your lemans to-day; 

												    And to-morrow shall the fox from her chambers in the rocks 

												    Lead forth her tawny cubs to howl above the prey. 
												  æ
												  Where be your tongues, that late mocked at heaven, and hell, and fate? 

												    And the fingers that once were so busy with your blades? 

												    Your perfumed satin clothes, your catches and your oaths? 

												    Your stage plays and your sonnets, your diamonds and your spades? 
												  æ
												  Down! down! forever down, with the mitre and the crown! 

												    With the Belial of the court, and the Mammon of the Pope! 

												    There is woe in Oxford halls, there is wail in Durham's stalls; 

												    The Jesuit smites his bosom, the bishop rends his cope. 
												  æ
												  And she of the seven hills shall mourn her children's ills, 

												    And tremble when she thinks on the edge of England's sword; 

												    And the kings of earth in fear shall shudder when they hear 

											    What the hand of God hath wrought for the houses and the word!



Death Poems

#######################################################

Because I could not stop for Death,

												    He kindly stopped for me;

												    The carriage held but just ourselves

											      And Immortality. 
												  æ
												  We slowly drove, he knew no haste,

												    And I had put away

												    My labor, and my leisure too,

												    For his civility.
												  æ
												  We passed the school where children played,

												    Their lessons scarcely done;

												    We passed the fields of gazing grain,

												    We passed the setting sun.
												  æ
												  We paused before a house that seemed

												    A swelling of the ground;

												    The roof was scarcely visible,

												    The cornice but a mound.
												  æ
												  Since then 't is centuries; but each

												    Feels shorter than the day

												    I first surmised the horses' heads

											    Were toward eternity.



War Poems

#######################################################

Chariots rumble and roll: horses whinny and neigh.

												    footmen at their girdle bows and arrows display.

												    Fathers, mothers, wives, and children by them go--

												    'Tis not the choking dust alone that strangles what they say!

												    Their clothes they clutch; their feet they stamp; their crush blocks up the way.

											      The sounds of weeping mount above the clouds that gloom the day.
												  æ
												  The passers-by inquire of them, "But whither do you go?"

												    They only say: "We're mustering--do not disturb us so."

												    These fifteen years and upwards, the Northern Pass defend;

												    And still at forty years of age their service does not end.

												    All young they left their villages--just registered were they--

												    The war they quitted sees again the same men worn and gray.

												    And all along the boundary their blood has made a sea.

												    But never till the World is his, will Wu Huang happy be!
												  æ
												  Have you not heard--in Shantung there two hundred districts lie.

												    All overgrown with briar and weed and wasted utterly?

												    The stouter women swing and hoe and guide the stubborn plough,

												    The fields have lost their boundaries--the corn grows wildly now.

												    And routed bands with hunger grim come down in disarray

												    To rob and rend and outrage them, and treat them as a prey.
												  æ
												  Although the leaders question them, the soldiers' plaints resound.

												    And winter has not stopped the war upon the western bound.

												    And war needs funds; the Magistrates for taxes press each day.

												    The land tax and the duties--Ah! how shall these be found?
												  æ
												  In times like this stout sons to bear is sorrow and dismay.

												    Far better girls--to marry, to a home not far away.

												    But sons!--are buried in the grass!--yon Tsaidam's waste survey!

												    The bones of those who fell before are bleaching on the plain.

												    Their spirits weep our ghosts to hear lamenting all their pain.

											    Beneath the gloomy sky there runs a wailing in the rain.



Religious Poems

#######################################################

The self-deceit of having wrought the light.
											    
												  PEOPLE arrive to worship in their church.
												  æ
												  Though it is getting tired and insecure,

												    The monument can make a gathering yet

												    With people poured into it by the roads.

												    It sifts them as they enter through its porch,

												    And gently it removes from each the thoughts

												    Which might not melt so well as all the rest,

												    Replacing them by others left behind

												    By those who came to Mass in days of old.
												  æ
												  The crowd which tramples on the flags outside

												    Bears nosegays of ideas new and bright;

												    The fresh dreams of to-day spread over them,

												    Rosy and blue as sunshades which in their

												    Own manner dye the radiance of the sky.
												  æ
												  Inside there are no nosegays and no sunshades.
												  æ
												  The naves and aisles are overflowing with

												    A crowd the pillars intimately know,

												    Their contact is as ancient as the church,

												    And every summer Sunday when the sun

												    Begins to lick the windows by one edge,

												    And in the winter of discoloured lamps,

												    For centuries this crowd has been reborn

												    On every following Sunday still the same.
												  æ
												  Women and men are entering in file.
												  æ
												  The crowd is borne in haste by all the doors,

												    Rumbling an instant, ordered, then appeased;

												    It has not changed its shape; it is already

												    Moulded unto the contours of the walls;

												    Faithfully bodies lean on the same chairs.

												    Now it is born again while ring the bells.
												  
												    But the dark power

												      That gives life

												      On the seventh day

												      Of every week,

												      Softens at last

												      Like an old spring,

												      Little by little

												      Born less far

												      From death.
												    æ
												    It is a group

												      Worn out with use

												      Whose flesh grows flabby.

												      And in the winter

												      It is cold

												      Under the roof.

												      In olden days,

												      In the city
											    
												  It was the greatest of unanimous beings,

												    And all the city was transfused in it.

												    But now the workshops have arisen,

												    The workshops full of youth!

												    They live in ardour.

												    Their smoke soars higher than the sound of bells.

												    They do not fear to hide the sun,

											      For their machines make sunshine.
												  æ
												  Like a dog that comes out of a pool and sneezes,

												    The workshop shivering scatters round it drops

												    Of energy that wake the town to life.
												  
												    But the senile group

												      Sprouts not with bristling

												      Wires and cables.

												      No electricity

												      Rustles from it

												      To countless houses.
												    æ
												    It is feeble,

												      Its chinks are stopped,

												      It is gathered in.
											    
												  But it preserves with pride its fixed idea:

												    Others may swell with sap and ramify;

												    And shadow with a foliage of green forces

												    All the massed houses;

												    The humble group would tenderly, heart to heart,

												    Speak to the infinite group benevolent words.

											      For it is sure a soul stands o'er the world.
												  æ
												  It knows God's finger painlessly from Heaven

												    Leads the leash of natural forces;

												    That God sees all, and that His tender eyes

												    Wrap up the form and penetrate the essence

												    Of things.

												    The group is sure of it.

												    But fears

												    Lest having to keep watch o'er all these minds

												    And bodies, all these angels, beasts, and deaths,

												    Ant-hills, cities, forests,

												    Planets and planetary systems,

												    God see no more the little auditory

												    Which listens to the Mass in pillared shade.
												  æ
												  It calls Him; makes to Him the holy signs.

												    In olden days God taught His creatures words

												    Which force Him to give heed and to vouchsafe.
												  æ
												  The group that mumbles them knows not their meaning,

												    But knows the priest before the altar knows:

												    The illuminated summit of the group.
												  æ
												  Upon the murmurs serving it as rollers

												    Slowly the common thought advances, like

												    A boat that fishers launch into the sea;

												    And onward floats the thought of God.
												  æ
												  From hearts the fervour passes to the walls,

												    The rising fluid magnetizes

												    The steeple, and the steeple brings down God.
												  
												    God approaches, God descends;

												      He is quite near; the air

												      Weighs heavier.
												    æ
												    Something compresses, heats it;

												      The choir is filled with incense

												      So that, arriving, God

												      Shall find here clouds

												      Like those He dwells in,

												      And feel less strange.
											    
												  He is quite near, quite near. You can whisper to Him,

												    Tell Him what you would dare tell no man, ask Him

												    For anything you like. And even if God

											      Refuse, He is so good you cannot vex Him.
												  æ
												  "O God in Heaven, vouchsafe to cure my leg!

												    Matter burst from it yesterday.--My God,

												    Vouchsafe to fill my shop with customers!

												    --Help me to find out if my servant John

												    Is robbing me!--O God, cure my sore eyes!

												    --Save me, my God, from getting drunk so often!

												    --Lord, let my son pass his examination!

												    He is so shy. Thou shalt have a great big candle.

												    --Help me to make her fall in love with me,

												    I will put ninepence in St. Anthony's box.

												    --My God! if only I could get some work!

												    --He makes a martyr of me. Let him die!

												    --My God, my God, I am certain I am pregnant;

												    O let the child go rotten in my belly."
												  æ
												  It is like a hamlet at the hour of noon.

												    On every soul's hearth they have kindled fire,

												    Which casts its smoke and yields it to the wind.

												    God sees the bluish prayers climb up to Him.
												  æ
												  They are a perfume which delight Him. He

												    Comes nearer. The crowd rises, touches Him.

												    Their longing to caress serves them for arm.

												    They seize on God to press Him close to them;

												    To be alone and to possess Him all.
												  æ
												  This morning, God, the conscience of the universe,

												    Has from the universe withdrawn, like blood

												    Out of a bull's limbs bleeding at the head.

												    All the world's soul, the whole of God is here;

												    The church is the glad vase that gathers Him.
												  æ
												  God now can think but of the little crowd;

												    The things they wish He too must wish, since He

												    In them is incarnated and their breath.
												  
												    Then in the mystical certitude;

												      Drunk with alcohol

												      Hid in the organ notes,

												      The light of the rose-window,

												      And the stained glass;

												      Clad with incense like

												      A scented sleep that bends and swoons;

												      By old, magnetic rites

												      Plunged in hypnotic sleep

												      Whence mount, like bubbles

												      Crossing stagnant waters,

												      Memories and mouldiness

												      And age-old madness;

												      Forgetting that beyond these walls

												      There is the town, and earth,

												      And then infinity;

												      The group so old, so little,

												      Which withers, which is scarce alive,

												      Dreams aloud that it is God.



New York Poems

#######################################################

The city is gritty, dark, and hard.

												    The subways rumble on and on.

												    The rats scurry as the people overflow

											    Onto the station and up to the neon show.
												  æ
										        Outsiders look up, locals look straight.

												    The hawkers haggle, the hookers wait.

												    The traffic rushes scornful of the streets

												    Marred and littered with a million moving feet.
										        æ
											    And yet the congregations grow. 

												    Worldly masses turn and flow

												    To money as muslims do to Mecca. 

												    And pilgrims walk amidst the glimpses of gods in Tribeca.



Bird Poems

#######################################################

I hear your repeated syllable 

												    of loneliness and despair 

												    come across this ploughed meadow 

												    as I search for arrowheads. 

												    Ancient bird, 

												    watching from your pine perch, 

												    remembering 

												    the campfires 

												    of those who brought us here 

												    and their prayers 

												    that went up like smoke in the wind 

												    leaving only some stone intentions 

											      to survive.



Death Poems

#######################################################

A small house with a dog in front ...

												    O my love! Tonight, this rose is wet.

												    In the big park, by the rusty gate,

											      I walk with you in a timeless dream.
												  æ
												  It drizzles outside; come here, come ... the wind

												    In the bay-trees sobs ... Oh! Don't be frightened!

												    Keep your little arms around my neck ...

												    Let us make our dead hearts living again.
												  æ
												  Plunge with your soft eyes of dark violet

												    Into my sad and serious glance which reflects

												    My grief ... Hear my voice ... It is the death knell.
												  æ
												  I lead her gently in her little dress,

												    The one I loved, my little dead girl

											    With pale face and lilacs in her wax hands.



War Poems

#######################################################

Amid these days of order, ease, prosperity,

												    Amid the current songs of beauty, peace, decorum,

												    I cast a reminiscence--(likely 'twill offend you,

												    I heard it in my boyhood;)--More than a generation since,

												    A queer old savage man, a fighter under Washington himself,

												    (Large, brave, cleanly, hot-blooded, no talker, rather spiritualistic,

												    Had fought in the ranks--fought well--had been all through the

												    Revolutionary war,)

												    Lay dying--sons, daughters, church-deacons, lovingly tending him,

												    Sharping their sense, their ears, towards his murmuring, half-caught words:

"Let me return again to my war-days,

												    To the sights and scenes--to forming the line of battle,

												    To the scouts ahead reconnoitering,

												    To the cannons, the grim artillery,

												    To the galloping aides, carrying orders,

												    To the wounded, the fallen, the heat, the suspense,

												    The perfume strong, the smoke, the deafening noise;

												    Away with your life of peace!--your joys of peace!

											      Give me my old wild battle-life again!"



War Poems

#######################################################

not of the salt-mill of stars

											      in the bleak night skies
												  æ
												  not of the chill mists slipping

												    from hillsides, and the eerie stillness

												    that falls over village, over road, 

												    over goat and sheep trail, 

												    the look-out posts
												  æ
												  not of the taste of grit dust, 

												    of sand on fear-dry lips, 

												    or the way it clogs nostrils

												    and places veilings over eyes 

												    so you understand why faces of locals 

												    are swathed in scarves
												  æ
												  not of the fact that there is not ever

												    the slightest chance youäó»d catch a glance

												    of a sniperäó»s profile, only fire flash

												    barking through darkness 

												    from distant Kalashnikovs
												  æ
												  not of the wide open faces of mates

												    collapsing to caricatures of string-puppets 

												    sliding äóñ slowly, slowly äóñ out of action, 

												    heads lolloping forward, 

												    and limbs slithering 

												    as when bullets bring into flower 

												    their fleshy wounds,

												    startling, blood-fresh
												  æ
								                no, not any of this:

												    all that goes without saying,

												    is part of the job 
								                æ
											    but of the fact that last night

												    on patrol in Helmand Province, 

												    their son

												    became the one hundredth serviceman 

												    so far this year



War Poems

#######################################################

There were three colors in the banner bright

												    On which the maidens stitched and stitched all day.

												    Their needles glanced, for with the morning light

											    Each saw her hero-lover march away.
												  æ
										        Save one the maidens stitch with fond proud haste;

												    And her they chide, "Why do thy fingers lag?

												    Think but how fair will gleam, by farm and waste,

												    The red and white and blue of their loved flag."
										        æ
											    The maiden lifted neither hands nor eyes:

												    "The red of flowing blood I see," she said,

												    "The white of faces upturned to the skies,

												    The blue of heaven wide above the dead."



Ocean Poems

#######################################################

The Ocean said to me once,

												    "Look!

												    Yonder on the shore

												    Is a woman, weeping.

												    I have watched her.

												    Go you and tell her this--

												    Her lover I have laid

												    In cool green hall.

												    There is wealth of golden sand

												    And pillars, coral-red;

											      Two white fish stand guard at his bier.
												  æ
										        Tell her this

												    And more--

												    That the king of the seas

												    Weeps too, old, helpless man.

												    The bustling Fates

												    Heap his hands with corpses

												    Until he stands like a child

												    With surplus of toys."



Moon Poems

#######################################################

How long shall I tarnish the mirror of life,

												    A spatter of rust on its polished steel!

												    The seasons reel

												    Like a goaded wheel.

											      Half-numb, half-maddened, my days are strife.
												  æ
												  The night is sliding towards the dawn,

												    And upturned hills crouch at autumn's knees.

												    A torn moon flees

												    Through the hemlock trees,

												    The hours have gnawed it to feed their spawn.
												  æ
												  Pursuing and jeering the misshapen thing

												    A rabble of clouds flares out of the east.

												    Like dogs unleashed

												    After a beast,

												    They stream on the sky, an outflung string.
												  æ
												  A desolate wind, through the unpeopled dark,

												    Shakes the bushes and whistles through empty nests,

												    And the fierce unrests

												    I keep as guests

												    Crowd my brain with corpses, pallid and stark.
												  æ
												  Leave me in peace, O Spectres, who haunt

												    My labouring mind, I have fought and failed.

												    I have not quailed,

												    I was all unmailed

												    And naked I strove, 'tis my only vaunt.
												  æ
												  The moon drops into the silver day

												    As waking out of her swoon she comes.

												    I hear the drums

												    Of millenniums

												    Beating the mornings I still must stay.
												  æ
												  The years I must watch go in and out,

												    While I build with water, and dig in air,

												    And the trumpets blare

												    Hollow despair,

												    The shuddering trumpets of utter rout.
												  æ
												  An atom tossed in a chaos made

												    Of yeasting worlds, which bubble and foam.

												    Whence have I come?

												    What would be home?

												    I hear no answer.  I am afraid!
												  æ
												  I crave to be lost like a wind-blown flame.

												    Pushed into nothingness by a breath,

												    And quench in a wreath

												    Of engulfing death

											    This fight for a God, or this devil's game.



Religious Poems

#######################################################

The sorry prayers go up to God

												    Day after weary day,

												    Whimpering through the eternal blue

											    And down the Milky Way.
												  æ
												  Deaf to the music of the stars,

												    The children of desire,

												    Beggars before the Throne of God

											    They wait for God to tire.
												  æ
												  The proletariat of Heaven

												    Swarmed in the Golden Street

												    One day when Michael's host came by

											    Up to the Judgment Seat.
												  æ
												  Above the Heavenly Mansions

												    Bright, streaming banners flowed,

												    While Cherubim and Seraphim

											    Were crowding in the road.
												  æ
												  And then a little, laughing prayer

												    Came running from the sky,

												    Along the golden gutters where

											    The sorry prayers go by.
												  æ
												  It had no fear of anything,

												    But in that holy place

												    It found the very Throne of God

											    And smiled up in His face.
												  æ
										        Then Michael waited in the road,

												    For Michael understood,

												    While God looked on the laughing prayer

												    And found it sweet and good.
										        æ
											    So God was comforted. He said,

												    "There still is hope for men,

												    One man prays happily." And so

												    He turned to care again.



Children Poems

#######################################################

The little boy lost in the lonely fen,

												    Led by the wandering light,

												    Began to cry, but God, ever nigh,

											      Appeared like his father, in white.
												  æ
												   He kissed the child, and by the hand led,

												    And to his mother brought,

												    Who in sorrow pale, through the lonely dale,

											    The little boy weeping sought.



Love Poems

#######################################################

She has griffins twain to guard her gate,

												    A mastiff-hound to watch in her hall,

												    A page for her train when she walks in state,

												    And minstrels and maidens around her to wait,

												    And lovers and gallants at beck and call;

												    But ah! she left her shutter a-jar

											      For the cool to climb over the window-bar!
												  æ
										        The griffins grinn'd in the moonlight green,

												    The hound by the grim red embers slept;

												    I scraped a chord on my mandoline,

												    A chord, PardíÂ, that might ruin a queen!

												    And softly a-down the garden I crept;

												    And, ah! the song slid thro' the shutter a-jar,

												    And the lady lean'd over the window-bar!



Snow Poems

#######################################################

ALWAYS the same, when on a fated night

												    At last the gathered snow lets down as white

												    As may be in dark woods, and with a song

												    It shall not make again all winter long

												    Of hissing on the yet uncovered ground,

												    I almost stumble looking up and round,

												    As one who overtaken by the end

												    Gives up his errand, and lets death descend

												    Upon him where he is, with nothing done

												    To evil, no important triumph won,

											      More than if life had never been begun.
												  æ
												  Yet all the precedent is on my side:

												    I know that winter death has never tried

												    The earth but it has failed: the snow may heap

												    In long storms an undrifted four feet deep

												    As measured against maple, birch and oak,

												    It cannot check the peeper's silver croak;

												    And I shall see the snow all go down hill

												    In water of a slender April rill

												    That flashes tail through last year's withered brake

												    And dead weeds, like a disappearing snake.

												    Nothing will be left white but here a birch,

											    And there a clump of houses with a church.



Nature

#######################################################

I shall foot it
Down the roadway in the dusk,
Where shapes of hunger wander
And the fugitives of pain go by.

I shall foot it
In the silence of the morning,
See the night slur into dawn,
Hear the slow great winds arise
Where tall trees flank the way
And shoulder toward the sky.

The broken boulders by the road
Shall not commemorate my ruin.
Regret shall be the gravel under foot.
I shall watch for
Slim birds swift of wing
That go where wind and ranks of thunder
Drive the wild processionals of rain.

The dust of the travelled road
Shall touch my hands and face.



Nature

#######################################################

Out of the winds' and the waves' riot,
Out of the loud foam,
He has put in to a great quiet
And a still home.

Here he may lie at ease and wonder
Why the old ship waits,
And hark for the surge and the strong thunder
Of the full Straits,

And look for the fishing fleet at morning,
Shadows like lost souls,
Slide through the fog where the seal's warning
Betrays the shoals,

And watch for the deep-sea liner climbing
Out of the bright West,
With a salmon-sky and her wake shining
Like a tern's breast, 

And never know he is done for ever
With the old sea's pride,
Borne from the fight and the full endeavour
On an ebb tide.



War Poems

#######################################################

Awake, little daughter, awake!

												    The sad moon is weaving her shroud;

												    The pale, drooping lily-bells quake;

												    The river is sobbing aloud.

												    I wand your sweet face in my sight,

												    While I open my room to the night:

												    The torn clouds are flying, the lupine is sighing,

											    The whip-poor-will wails in affright.
												  æ
												  There's a shadow just marked on the floor--

												    Now soaring and breaking its bond;

												    'T is the woodbine, perhaps, by the door,

												    Or the blooming acacia beyond.

												    Oh, pitiful weakness of grief!

												    Oh, trouble, of troubles the chief!

												    When shades can assail us, and terrors impale us,

											    At sight of a quivering leaf.
												  æ
												  I weep, little daughter, I weep;

												    But chide me not, love, for I heard,

												    Three times in the depth of my sleep,

												    The clang of a terrible word.

												    "Your Harry is dying," it cried;

												    "Is dying" and "dying," it sighed;

												    As bells that, in tolling, set echoes to rolling,

											    Till fainting sound ebbs like the tide.
												  æ
												  Then the walls of my room fell away;

												    My eye pierced the distance afar,

												    Where, by the plowed field of the fray,

												    The camp-fire shone out like a star.

												    And southward, unhindered, I fled,

												    By the instinct of motherhood led;

												    The night-wind was blowing, the red blood was flowing,

											    And Harry was dying--was dead!
												  æ
												  I dreamed, little daughter, I dreamed--

												    Look! the window is lit by a face.

												    It is not? Well, how lifelike it seemed!

												    Go, draw down the curtains of lace.

												    It may be 't was only a flower;

												    For fancy has wonderful power.

												    The loud wind is whirring--hark! something is stirring--

											    'T is midnight--the clock knells the hour.
										        
											        * * * * *
										        
											    The horseman had ridden all night;

												    His garments were spotted with gore;

												    His foot crushed the lily-bells white--

												    He entered the vine-covered door.

												    "Your Harry is dying," he said:

												    The mother just lifted her head,

												    And answered, unweeping, like one who is sleeping,

												    "Not dying, good soldier, but dead!"



War Poems

#######################################################

äóìGIVE us a song!äó the soldiers cried, 

												    The outer trenches guarding, 

												    When the heated guns of the camps allied 

												    Grew weary of bombarding. 

                                                    

												    The dark Redan, in silent scoff,

												    Lay, grim and threatening, under; 

												    And the tawny mound of the Malakoff 

												    No longer belched its thunder. 

                                                    

												    There was a pause. A guardsman said,

												    äóìWe storm the forts to-morrow;

												    Sing while we may, another day 

												    Will bring enough of sorrow.äó 

                                                    

												    They lay along the batteryäó»s side, 

												    Below the smoking cannon: 

												    Brave hearts, from Severn and from Clyde,

												    And from the banks of Shannon. 

                                                    

												    They sang of love, and not of fame; 

												    Forgot was Britainäó»s glory: 

												    Each heart recalled a different name, 

												    But all sang äóìAnnie Laurie.äó

                                                    

												    Voice after voice caught up the song, 

												    Until its tender passion 

												    Rose like an anthem, rich and strong,äóî 

												    Their battle-eve confession. 

                                                    

												    Dear girl, her name he dared not speak,

												    But, as the song grew louder, 

												    Something upon the soldieräó»s cheek 

												    Washed off the stains of powder. 

                                                    

												    Beyond the darkening ocean burned 

												    The bloody sunsetäó»s embers,

												    While the Crimean valleys learned 

												    How English love remembers. 

                                                    

												    And once again a fire of hell 

												    Rained on the Russian quarters, 

												    With scream of shot, and burst of shell,

												    And bellowing of the mortars! 

                                                    

												    And Irish Noraäó»s eyes are dim 

												    For a singer, dumb and gory; 

												    And English Mary mourns for him 

												    Who sang of äóìAnnie Laurie.äó

                                                    

												    Sleep, soldiers! still in honored rest 

												    Your truth and valor wearing: 

												    The bravest are the tenderest,äóî 

											      The loving are the daring.



Morning Poems

#######################################################

THE sound of the closing outside door was all.

												    You made no sound in the grass with your footfall,

												    As far as you went from the door, which was not far;

												    But you had awakened under the morning star

												    The first song-bird that awakened all the rest.

												    He could have slept but a moment more at best.

												    Already determined dawn began to lay

												    In place across a cloud the slender ray

												    For prying beneath and forcing the lids of sight,

												    And loosing the pent-up music of over-night.

												    But dawn was not to begin their "pearly-pearly"

												    (By which they mean the rain is pearls so early,

												    Before it changes to diamonds in the sun),

												    Neither was song that day to be self-begun.

												    You had begun it, and if there needed proof--

												    I was asleep still under the dripping roof,

												    My window curtain hung over the sill to wet;

												    But I should awake to confirm your story yet;

												    I should be willing to say and help you say

											      That once you had opened the valley's singing day.



War Poems

#######################################################

Underneath the autumn sky,

												    Haltingly, the lines go by.

												    Ah, would steps were blithe and gay,

												    As when first they marched away,

												    Smile on lip and curl on brow--

												    Only white-faced gray-beards now,

												    Standing on life's outer verge,

											    E'en the marches sound a dirge.
												  æ
												  Blow, you bugles, play, you fife,

												    Rattle, drums, for dearest life.

												    Let the flags wave freely so,

												    As the marching legions go,

												    Shout, hurrah and laugh and jest,

												    This is memory at its best.

												    (Did you notice at your quip,

											    That old comrade's quivering lip?)
												  æ
												  Ah, I see them as they come,

												    Stumbling with the rumbling drum;

												    But a sight more sad to me

												    E'en than these ranks could be

												    Was that one with cane upraised

												    Who stood by and gazed and gazed,

												    Trembling, solemn, lips compressed,

											    Longing to be with the rest.
												  æ
										        Did he dream of old alarms,

												    As he stood, "presented arms"?

												    Did he think of field and camp

												    And the unremitting tramp

												    Mile on mile--the lonely guard

												    When he kept his midnight ward?

												    Did he dream of wounds and scars

												    In that bitter war of wars?
										        æ
											    What of that? He stood and stands

												    In my memory--trembling hands,

												    Whitened beard and cane and all

												    As if waiting for the call

												    Once again: "To arms, my sons,"

												    And his ears hear far-off guns,

												    Roll of cannon and the tread

												    Of the legions of the Dead!



Women Poems

#######################################################

The woman with jewels sits in the cafí©,

												    Spraying light like a fountain.

												    Diamonds glitter on her bulbous fingers

												    And on her arms, great as thighs,

												    Diamonds gush from her ear-lobes over the goitrous throat.

												    She is obesely beautiful.

												    Her eyes are full of bleared lights,

												    Like little pools of tar, spilled by a sailor in mad haste for shore ...

											    And her mouth is scarlet and full--only a little crumpled--like a flower that has been pressed apart ...
												  æ
												  Why does she come alone to this obscure basement--

											    She who should have a litter and hand-maidens to support her on either side?
												  æ
										        She ascends the stairway, and the waiters turn to look at her, spilling the soup.

												    The black satin dress is a little lifted, showing the dropsical legs in their silken fleshlings ...

												    The mountainous breasts tremble ...

												    There is an agitation in her gems,

												    That quiver incessantly, emitting trillions of fiery rays ...
										        æ
											    She erupts explosive breaths ...

												    Every step is an adventure

												    From this ...

												    The serpent's tooth

												    Saved Cleopatra.



Death Poems

#######################################################

OVER the dead line we have called to you

												    To come across with a word to us,

												    Some beaten whisper of what happens

												    Where you are over the dead line

											      Deaf to our calls and voiceless.
												  æ
												  The flickering shadows have not answered

												    Nor your lips sent a signal

												    Whether love talks and roses grow

												    And the sun breaks at morning

											    Splattering the sea with crimson.



Children Poems

#######################################################

In the land of Wu the mulberry leaves are green,

												    And thrice the silkworms have gone to sleep.

												    In East Luh where my family stay,

												    I wonder who is sowing those fields of ours.

												    I cannot be back in time for the spring doings,

												    Yet I can help nothing, traveling on the river.

												    The south wind blowing wafts my homesick spirit

												    And carries it up to the front of our familiar tavern.

												    There I see a peach tree on the east side of the house

												    With thick leaves and branches waving in the blue mist.

												    It is the tree I planted before my parting three years ago.

												    The peach tree has grown now as tall as the tavern roof,

												    While I have wandered about without returning.

												    Ping-yang, my pretty daughter, I see you stand

												    by the peach tree and pluck a flowering branch.

												    You pluck the flowers, but I am not there--

												    How your tears flow like a stream of water!

												    My little son, Po-chin, grown up to your sister's shoulders,

												    You come out with her under the peach tree,

												    But who is there to pat you on the back?

												    When I think of these things, my senses fail,

												    And a sharp pain cuts my heart every day.

												    Now I tear off a piece of white silk to write this letter,

											      And send it to you with my love a long way up the river.



Funeral Poems

#######################################################

I walked upon a hill

												    And the wind, made solemnly drunk with your presence,

												    Reeled against me.

												    I stooped to question a flower,

												    And you floated between my fingers and the petals,

												    Tying them together.

												    I severed a leaf from its tree

												    And a water-drop in the green flagon

												    Cupped a hunted bit of your smile.

												    All things about me were steeped in your remembrance

											      And shivering as they tried to tell me of it.



War Poems

#######################################################

Vigil strange I kept on the field one night;

												    When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day,

												    One look I but gave which your dear eyes return'd with a look I

												    shall never forget,

												    One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach'd up as you lay on the ground,

												    Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle,

												    Till late in the night reliev'd to the place at last again I made my way,

												    Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of

												    responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)

												    Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the

												    moderate night-wind,

												    Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the

												    battlefield spreading,

												    Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night,

												    But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed,

												    Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my

												    chin in my hands,

												    Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest

												    comrade--not a tear, not a word,

												    Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my soldier,

												    As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole,

												    Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your death,

												    I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall

												    surely meet again,)

												    Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appear'd,

												    My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his form,

												    Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and

												    carefully under feet,

												    And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his

												    grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited,

												    Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field dim,

												    Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)

												    Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day

												    brighten'd,

												    I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket,

											      And buried him where he fell.



War Poems

#######################################################

Do not weep, maiden, for war is kind.

												    Because your lover threw wild hands toward the sky

												    And the affrighted steed ran on alone,

												    Do not weep.

											    War is kind.
												  æ
												  Hoarse, booming drums of the regiment,

												    Little souls who thirst for fight,

												    These men were born to drill and die.

												    The unexplained glory flies above them,

												    Great is the battle-god, great, and his kingdom--

											    A field where a thousand corpses lie.
												  æ
												  Do not weep, babe, for war is kind.

												    Because your father tumbled in the yellow trenches,

												    Raged at his breast, gulped and died,

												    Do not weep.

											    War is kind.
												  æ
										        Swift blazing flag of the regiment,

												    Eagle with crest of red and gold,

												    These men were born to drill and die.

												    Point for them the virtue of slaughter,

												    Make plain to them the excellence of killing

												    And a field where a thousand corpses lie.
										        æ
											    Mother whose heart hung humble as a button

												    On the bright splendid shroud of your son,

												    Do not weep.

												    War is kind.



Star Poems

#######################################################

When I heard the learn'd astronomer,

												    When the proofs, the figures, were ranged in columns before me,

												    When I was shown the charts and diagrams, to add, divide, and measure them,

												    When I sitting heard the astronomer where he lectured with much

												    applause in the lecture-room,

												    How soon unaccountable I became tired and sick,

												    Till rising and gliding out I wander'd off by myself,

												    In the mystical moist night-air, and from time to time,

											      Look'd up in perfect silence at the stars.



Night Poems

#######################################################

When the eye of day is shut,

												    And the stars deny their beams,

												    And about the forest hut

											      Blows the roaring wood of dreams,
												  æ
												  From deep clay, from desert rock,

												    From the sunk sands of the main,

												    Come not at my door to knock,

											    Hearts that loved me not again.
												  æ
								                Sleep, be still, turn to your rest

												    In the lands where you are laid;

												    In far lodgings east and west

												    Lie down on the beds you made.
								                æ
									            In gross marl, in blowing dust,

												    In the drowned ooze of the sea,

												    Where you would not, lie you must,

												    Lie you must, and not with me.



Children Poems

#######################################################

Oh dear, where is the Baby gone?

												    I can't tell where I missed him;

												    Why only last night in his crib

												    I tucked him safe and kissed him!

												    This boy, with marbles, top and ball,

												    In knickerbockers dressed,

												    This cannot be the baby small

											    I cradled in my breast.
												  æ
												  I wanted the weenty teenty thing

												    In dresses soft and white,

												    That I could cuddle, kiss, and sing

												    Soft by-lows to at night.

												    But stay--here are the self-same eyes,

												    His very dimpled chin,

												    These are his rosy pouting lips

											    With milk-white teeth within.
												  æ
										        This is my Baby.--But how changed!

												    I hear his merry shout

												    As he goes sliding down the stair,

												    And dancing in and out;

												    Splashing and dashing through the brook,

												    With brow and check of tan.

												    Heigho! My baby's gone; instead

												    I see,--a little man.
										        æ
											    Ah well, when evening comes again

												    With sleep and story-time,

												    A little white-gowned form will come

												    Into my lap to climb;

												    His wee head cradled on my heart

												    Will still this yearning pain.

												    O then I'll know that I have found

												    My baby-boy again!



Love Poems

#######################################################

The feverish room and that white bed,

												    The tumbled skirts upon a chair,

												    The novel flung half-open where

											      Hat, hair-pins, puffs, and paints, are spread;
												  æ
												  The mirror that has sucked your face

												    Into its secret deep of deeps,

												    And there mysteriously keeps

												    Forgotten memories of grace;
												  æ
												  And you, half-dressed and half awake,

												    Your slant eyes strangely watching me,

												    And I, who watch you drowsily,

												    With eyes that, having slept not, ache;
												  æ
												  This (need one dread? nay, dare one hope?)

												    Will rise, a ghost of memory, if

												    Ever again my handkerchief

											    Is scented with White Heliotrope.



Flower Poems

#######################################################

LOVERS, forget your love, 

												    And list to the love of these, 

												    She a window flower, 

												    And he a winter breeze. 

												    When the frosty window veil 

												    Was melted down at noon, 

												    And the cagíÂd yellow bird 

												    Hung over her in tune, 

												    He marked her through the pane, 

												    He could not help but mark, 

												    And only passed her by, 

												    To come again at dark. 

												    He was a winter wind, 

												    Concerned with ice and snow, 

												    Dead weeds and unmated birds, 

												    And little of love could know. 

												    But he sighed upon the sill, 

												    He gave the sash a shake, 

												    As witness all within 

												    Who lay that night awake. 

												    Perchance he half prevailed 

												    To win her for the flight 

												    From the firelit looking-glass 

												    And warm stove-window light. 

												    But the flower leaned aside 

												    And thought of naught to say, 

												    And morning found the breeze 

											      A hundred miles away.



Winter Poems

#######################################################

Fair is the sky, for the cloud-rack is lifted--

												    Bright will the day be, though dark was the morn;

												    Warm was the morn, but the strong wind has shifted

												    Into the north--where the blizzards are born.

												    White coward mercury goes down to zero--

												    Darting about flies a veteran jay,

												    Braving the breeze, like a blue-coated hero--

											    Seeking his supper, I venture to say.
												  æ
												  Neighbors pass hurriedly, mantled and muffled--

												    Great coats, and seal-skins, to keep out the storm--

												    Plump little quail, with their plumage beruffled,

												    Search in the hedge for a nook that is warm.

												    That latest blast from the boreal bellows,

												    Drifted some snow-birds the garden below;

												    Always their coming, the wise-acres tell us,

											    Tokens cold weather, and flurries of snow.
												  æ
										        Warm sheltered corners the cattle have chosen,

												    Shivers the pine in its evergreen leaves;

												    Pools by the roadside in wrinkles are frozen--

												    Bayonet icicles hang from the eaves.

												    Five English sparrows, defying the weather,

												    There in the pathway a conference hold;

												    Ho! merry midgets in doublets of feathers!

												    Why do you rally out there in the cold?
										        æ
											    Little you care for the riot and rattle--

												    Little you heed--let the mercury fall!

												    Brave little fighters, go on with your battle--

												    Here is a friend who will welcome you all!

												    Fly to my window--I'll feed every comer--

												    Hail to the comrades that constancy show

												    Loving and loyal, in winter and summer--

												    With us, alike, in the heat and the snow!



Winter Poems

#######################################################

Oh, who would be sad tho' the sky be a-graying,

												    And meadow and woodlands are empty and bare;

												    For softly and merrily now there come playing,

											    The little white birds thro' the winter-kissed air.
												  æ
										        The squirrel's enjoying the rest of the thrifty,

												    He munches his store in the old hollow tree;

												    Tho' cold is the blast and the snow-flakes are drifty

												    He fears the white flock not a whit more than we.
										        æ
											    Then heigho for the flying snow!

												    Over the whitened roads we go,

												    With pulses that tingle,

												    And sleigh-bells a-jingle

												    For winter's white birds here's a cheery heigho!



Women Poems

#######################################################

The working girls in the morning are going to work--long lines of them afoot amid the downtown stores and factories, thousands with little brick-shaped lunches wrapped in newspapers under their arms.

												    Each morning as I move through this river of young-woman life I feel a wonder about where it is all going, so many with a peach bloom of young years on them and laughter of red lips and memories in their eyes of dances the night before and plays and walks.

												    Green and gray streams run side by side in a river and so here are always the others, those who have been over the way, the women who know each one the end of life's gamble for her, the meaning and the clew, the how and the why of the dances and the arms that passed around their waists and the fingers that played in their hair.

												    Faces go by written over: "I know it all, I know where the bloom and the laughter go and I have memories," and the feet of these move slower and they have wisdom where the others have beauty.

												    So the green and the gray move in the early morning on the downtown streets.
