Life Poems

#######################################################

There was a man who lived a life of fire.

												    Even upon the fabric of Time,

												    Where purple becomes orange

												    And orange purple,

												    THis life glowed,

												    A dire red stain, indelible;

												    Yet when he was dead,

											      He saw that he had not lived.



Spring Poems

#######################################################

A bird chirped at my window this morning,

												    And over the sky is drawn a light net-work of clouds.

												    Come,

												    Let us go out into the open,

											      For my heart leaps like a fish that is ready to spawn.
												  æ
												  I will lie under the beech-trees,

												    Under the grey branches of the beech-trees,

												    In a blueness of little squills and crocuses.

												    I will lie among the little squills

												    And be delivered of this overcharge of beauty,

												    And that which is born shall be a joy to you

											    Who love me.



Death Poems

#######################################################

I've seen the cheek suffused with red

												    By death's cold hand laid pale,

												    Like flowrets bruised by ruthless tread

											    Or withered in the gale.
												  æ
												  I've seen the hoary-headed man

												    Outstep his three-score years,

												    With haggard visage, worn and wan,

											    Deep-furrowed with his tears.
												  æ
												  I've seen the sinless baby die,

												    I've seen its mother weep

												    To see her little darling lie

											    In death's long dreamless sleep.
												  æ
												  I've seen the pride of beauty fade

												    And pass from earth away;

												    I've seen the youth cut down and laid

											    Low in the mouldering clay.
												  æ
										        I've seen men rush to ruin's brink,

												    And some I've tried to save,

												    And some who bartered life for drink

												    I've followed to the grave.
										        æ
											    Thus have I seen the young and old,

												    The thoughtless and the gay,

												    The rich and poor, the meek, the bold

												    All borne by death away.



Narrative Poems

#######################################################

"Make way for liberty!" he cried,

												    Make way for liberty, and died.

												    In arms the Austrian phalanx stood,

												    A living wall, a human wood,--

												    A wall, where every conscious stone

												    Seemed to its kindred thousands grown.

												    A rampart all assaults to bear,

												    Till time to dust their frames should wear;

												    So still, so dense the Austrians stood,

											      A living wall, a human wood.
												  æ
												  Impregnable their front appears,

												    All horrent with projected spears.

												    Whose polished points before them shine,

												    From flank to flank, one brilliant line,

												    Bright as the breakers' splendours run

												    Along the billows to the sun.
												  æ
												  Opposed to these a hovering band

												    Contended for their fatherland;

												    Peasants, whose new-found strength had broke

												    From manly necks the ignoble yoke,

												    And beat their fetters into swords,

												    On equal terms to fight their lords;

												    And what insurgent rage had gained,

												    In many a mortal fray maintained;

												    Marshalled, once more, at Freedom's call,

												    They came to conquer or to fall,

												    Where he who conquered, he who fell,

												    Was deemed a dead or living Tell,

												    Such virtue had that patriot breathed,

												    So to the soil his soul bequeathed,

												    That wheresoe'er his arrows flew,

												    Heroes in his own likeness grew,

												    And warriors sprang from every sod,

												    Which his awakening footstep trod.
												  æ
												  And now the work of life and death

												    Hung on the passing of a breath;

												    The fire of conflict burned within,

												    The battle trembled to begin;

												    Yet, while the Austrians held their ground,

												    Point for attack was nowhere found;

												    Where'er the impatient Switzers gazed,

												    The unbroken line of lances blazed;

												    That line 'twere suicide to meet,

												    And perish at their tyrant's feet;

												    How could they rest within their graves,

												    And leave their homes, the homes of slaves!

												    Would not they feel their children tread,

												    With clanging chains, above their head?
												  æ
												  It must not be; this day, this hour,

												    Annihilates the invader's power;

												    All Switzerland is in the field;

												    She will not fly,--she cannot yield,--

												    She must not fall; her better fate

												    Here gives her an immortal date.

												    Few were the numbers she could boast,

												    But every freeman was a host,

												    And felt as 'twere a secret known

												    That one should turn the scale alone,

												    While each unto himself was he

												    On whose sole arm hung victory.
												  æ
												  It did depend on one indeed;

												    Behold him,--Arnold Winkelried;

												    There sounds not to the trump of fame

												    The echo of a nobler name.

												    Unmarked he stood amid the throng,

												    In rumination deep and long,

												    Till you might see, with sudden grace,

												    The very thought come o'er his face;

												    And, by the motion of his form,

												    Anticipate the bursting storm,

												    And, by the uplifting of his brow,

												    Tell where the bolt would strike, and how.
												  æ
												  But 'twas no sooner thought than done!

												    The field was in a moment won;

												    "Make way for liberty!" he cried,

												    Then ran, with arms extended wide,

												    As if his dearest friend to clasp;

												    Ten spears he swept within his grasp.

												    "Make way for liberty!" he cried.

												    Their keen points crossed from side to side;

												    He bowed amidst them like a tree,

												    And thus made way for liberty.
												  æ
												  Swift to the breach his comrades fly,

												    "Make way for liberty!" they cry,

												    And through the Austrian phalanx dart,

												    As rushed the spears through Arnold's heart.

												    While instantaneous as his fall,

												    Rout, ruin, panic, seized them all;

												    An earthquake could not overthrow

												    A city with a surer blow.
												  æ
												  Thus Switzerland again was free;

											    Thus Death made way for Liberty!



Love

#######################################################

This youth too long has heard the break
Of waters in a land of change.
He goes to see what suns can make
From soil more indurate and strange.

He cuts what holds his days together
And shuts him in, as lock on lock:
The arrowed vane announcing weather,
The tripping racket of a clock;

Seeking, I think, a light that waits
Still as a lamp upon a shelf, 
A land with hills like rocky gates
Where no sea leaps upon itself.

But he will find that nothing dares
To be enduring, save where, south
Of hidden deserts, torn fire glares
On beauty with a rusted mouth, 

Where something dreadful and another
Look quietly upon each other.



Narrative Poems

#######################################################

In the green darkness of a summer wood,

												    Wherethro' ran winding ways, a lady stood,

											      Carved from the air in curving womanhood.
												  æ
												  A maiden's form crowned by a matron's mien,

												    As, about Lammas, wheat stems may be seen,

												    The ear all golden, but the stalk still green.
												  æ
												  There as she stood, waiting for sight or sound,

												    Down a dim alley without break or bound,

												    Slowly he came, his gaze upon the ground.
												  æ
												  Nor ever once he lifted up his eyes

												    Till he no more her presence could disguise;

												    Then he her face saluted silentwise.
												  æ
												  And silentwise no less she turned, as though

												    She was the leaf and he the current's flow,

												    And where he went, there she perforce must go.
												  æ
												  And both kept speechless as the dumb or dead,

												    Nor did the earth so much as speak their tread,

												    So soft by last year's leaves 'twas carpeted.
												  æ
												  And not a sound moved all the greenwood through,

												    Save when some quest with fluttering wings outflew,

												    Ruffling the leaves; then silence was anew.
												  æ
												  And when the track they followed forked in twain,

												    They never doubted which one should be ta'en,

												    But chose as though obeying secret rein.
												  æ
												  Until they came where boughs no longer screened

												    The sky, and soon abruptly intervened

												    A rustic gate, and over it they leaned.
												  æ
												  Leaned over it, and green before them lay

												    A meadow ribbed with drying swathes of hay,

												    From which the hinds had lately gone away.
												  æ
												  Beyond it, yet more woods, these too at rest,

												    Smooth-dipping down to shore, unseen, but guessed;

												    For lo! the Sea, with nothing on its breast.
											    
												    I
											    
												  "I was sure you would come," she said, with a voice like a broken wing

												    That flutters, and fails, then flags, while it nurses the failure's sting;

												    "You could not refuse me that, 'tis but such a little thing.
											    
												    II
											    
												  "Do I remember the words, the farewell words that you spoke,

												    Answering soft with hard, ere we parted under the oak?

												    Remember them? Can I forget? For each of them cut like a stroke.
											    
												    III
											    
												  "True--were they true? You think so, or they had never been said;

												    But somehow, like lightning flashes, they flickered about my head,

												    Flickered but touched me not. They ought to have stricken me dead.
											    
												    IV
											    
												  "What do I want with you now? What I always wanted, you know;

												    A voice to be heard in the darkness, a flower to be seen in the snow,

												    And a bond linking each fresh future with a lengthening long ago.
												  
												    V
											    
												  "Is it too much? Too little! Well, little or much, 'tis all

												    That rescues my life from the nothing it seems to be when I call

												    For a life to reply, and my voice comes back like a voice from the wall.
											    
												    VI
											    
												  "If one played sweet on a lute, yea so soft that you scarce could hear,

												    Would you clang all the chords with your hand that the octaves might ring out clear?

												    Lo! asunder the strings are snapped, and the music shrinks silent for fear.
											    
												    VII
											    
												  "See! the earth through the infinite spaces goes silently round and round,

												    And the moon moveth on through the heavens and never maketh a sound,

												    And the wheels of eternity traverse their journey in stillness profound.
											    
												    VIII
											    
												  "'Tis only the barren breakers that bellow on barren shore;

												    'Tis only the braggart thunders that rumble and rage and roar;

												    Like a wave is the love that babbles; but silent love loves evermore.
												  
												    IX
											    
												  "Feeble, shadowy, shallow? Is ocean then shallow that keeps

												    Its harvest of shell and seaweed that none or garners or reaps,

												    That the diver may sound a moment, but never drag from its deeps?
											    
												    X
											    
												  "Cowardice? Yes, we are cowards; cowards from cradle to bier,

												    And the terror of life grows upon us as we grow year by year;

												    Our smiles are but trembling ripples urged on by a subtide of fear.
												  
												    XI
											    
												  "And hence, or at substance or shadow we start, though we scarce know why,

												    Life seems like a haunted wood, where we tremble and crouch and cry.

												    Beast, or robber, or ghost--our courage is still to fly.
												  
												    XII
											    
												  "So we look around for a guide, and to place all our fears in his hand,

												    That his courage may keep us brave, that his grandeur may make us grand:

												    But, remember, a guide, not an ambush. Oh, tell me you understand!
											    
												    XIII
											    
												  "Still silent, still unpersuaded. Ah! I know what your thoughts repeat.

												    We are all alike, and we love to keep passion aglow at our feet,

												    Like one that sitteth in shade and complacently smiles at the heat.
											    
												    XIV
											    
												  "You think so? Then come into shade. Rise up, take the seat at my side;

												    Or, see, I will kneel, not you. What is humble, if this be pride?

												    What seems cold now will chance feel warm when the fierce glare of noon hath died.
											    
												    XV
											    
												  "Have you never, when waves were breaking, watched children at sport on the beach,

												    With their little feet tempting the foam-fringe, till with stronger and further reach

												    Than they dreamed of, a billow comes bursting, how they turn and scamper and screech!
											    
												    XVI
											    
												  "Are we more than timider children? With its blending of terror and glee,

												    To us life--call it love, if you will--is a deep mysterious sea,

												    That we play with till it grows earnest; then straight we tremble and flee.
											    
												    XVII
											    
												  "Oh, never the pale east flushes with ripples of rising day,

												    Never, never, the birds awakening sing loud upon gable and spray,

												    But afresh you dawn on my life, and my soul chants its matin lay.
											    
												    XVIII
											    
												  "When the scent of the elder is wafted from the hedge in the cottage lane,

												    Up the walk, and over the terrace, and in at the open pane,

												    You are there, and my life seems perfumed like a garden after rain.
											    
												    XIX
											    
												  "The nightingale brings you nearer, the woodpecker borrows your voice;

												    The flower where the bees cling and cluster seems the flower of the flowers of your choice.

												    I am sad with the cloud of your sadness, with the joy of your joy I rejoice.
											    
												    XX
											    
												  "What dearer, what nearer would you? Once heart is betrothed to heart,

												    No closeness can bring them closer, no parting can put them apart.

												    Oh! take all the balm, leave the bitter, give the sweetness with none of its smart."
												  æ
												  The blue sea now had saddened into gray;

												    Solid and close the darkening woodlands lay,

												    And twilight's floating dews clung heavy with the hay.
												  æ
												  One with all these, he neither stirred nor spake,

												    Though for a sound the silence seemed to ache,

												    Waiting and wondering when his voice the pain would break.
												  æ
												  Then since the words hope forced despair to say

												    Seemed to have vanished with the vanished day,

												    She turned her from the gate, and slowly moved away.
												  æ
												  And he too turned; but pacing side by side,

												    This mocking nearness did them more divide,

												    Than if betwixt them moaned the round of ocean wide.
												  æ
												  But when o'erhead boughs once more met and spanned,

												    She halted, laid upon his arm her hand,

												    And questioned blank his face, his heart to understand.
												  æ
												  Had trust or tenderness been hovering there,

												    She would have known it in the duskiest air;

												    But face and form alike of every trace was bare.
												  æ
												  Her touch he neither welcomed nor repelled;

												    Pulses that once had quickened straight seemed quelled;

												    He stood like one that is by courteous bondage held.
												  æ
												  One hand thus foiled, the other rescuing came,

												    And in the darkness sheltered against shame,

												    She fawned on him with both, and trembled out his name.
												  æ
												  Then as a reaper, when the days are meet,

												    His sickle curves about the bending wheat,

												    He hollowed out his arms, and harvested his sweet.
											    
												    XXI
											    
												  "Now what shall I cling to?" she murmured, "Behold! I am week, you are strong.

												    Brief, brief is the bridal summer, the mourning of winter is long;

												    Never leave me unloved to discover love's right was but rapturous wrong!"
												  æ
												  Again was silence. Then she slowly felt

												    The clasp of cruel fondness round her melt,

												    And heard a voice that seemed the voice of one that knelt.
												  æ
												  "The long, long mourning of the winter days

												    Waits sure for them that bask in summer rays;

												    One must depart, then life is death to one that stays.
												  æ
												  "This fixed decree we can nor change nor cheat;

												    For I must either leave or lose you, sweet,

												    And all love's triumphs end in death and dark defeat.
												  æ
												  "Death is unconscious change, change conscious death.

												    Better to die outright than gasp for breath.

												    Life, dead, hath done with pain; Love, lingering, suffereth.
												  æ
												  "The only loss--and this may you be spared!--

												    For which who stake on love must be prepared,

												    Is still that, though life may, yet death can not be shared.
												  æ
												  "No other pain shall come to you from me.

												    What love withholds, love needs must ask. But, see!

												    Since you embrace love's chains, love's self doth set you free."
												  æ
												  So free they wandered, drinking with delight

												    The scented silence of the summer night,

												    And in the darkness saw what ne'er is seen in light.
												  æ
												  Hushed deep in slumber seemed all earthy jars,

												    And, looking up, they saw, 'twixt leafy bars,

											    The untrod fields of Heaven glistening with dewy stars.



Religious Poems

#######################################################

Into the furnace let me go alone;

												    Stay you without in terror of the heat.

												    I will go naked in--for thus 'tis sweet--

												    Into the weird depths of the hottest zone.

												    I will not quiver in the frailest bone,

												    You will not note a flicker of defeat;

												    My heart shall tremble not its fate to meet,

												    My mouth give utterance to any moan.

												    The yawning oven spits forth fiery spears;

												    Red aspish tongues shout wordlessly my name.

												    Desire destroys, consumes my mortal fears,

												    Transforming me into a shape of flame.

												    I will come out, back to your world of tears,

											      A stronger soul within a finer frame.



War Poems

#######################################################

Come up from the fields father, here's a letter from our Pete,

											      And come to the front door mother, here's a letter from thy dear son.
												  æ
												  Lo, 'tis autumn,

												    Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,

												    Cool and sweeten Ohio's villages with leaves fluttering in the

												    moderate wind,

												    Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis'd vines,

												    (Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?

												    Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing?)
												  æ
												  Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain, and

												    with wondrous clouds,

												    Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm prospers well.
												  æ
												  Down in the fields all prospers well,

												    But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter's call.

												    And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right away.
												  æ
												  Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps trembling,

												    She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap.
												  æ
												  Open the envelope quickly,

												    O this is not our son's writing, yet his name is sign'd,

												    O a strange hand writes for our dear son, O stricken mother's soul!

												    All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the main

												    words only,

												    Sentences broken, gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish,

												    taken to hospital,

												    At present low, but will soon be better.
												  æ
												  Ah now the single figure to me,

												    Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms,

												    Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,

												    By the jamb of a door leans.
												  æ
												  Grieve not so, dear mother, (the just-grown daughter speaks through

												    her sobs,

												    The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay'd,)

												    See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better.
												  æ
												  Alas poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may-be needs to be

												    better, that brave and simple soul,)

												    While they stand at home at the door he is dead already,

												    The only son is dead.
												  æ
												  But the mother needs to be better,

												    She with thin form presently drest in black,

												    By day her meals untouch'd, then at night fitfully sleeping, often waking,

												    In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,

												    O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape and withdraw,

											    To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son.



Death Poems

#######################################################

I shall walk down the road.

												    I shall turn and feel upon my feet

												    The kisses of Death, like scented rain.

												    For Death is a black slave with little silver birds

												    Perched in a sleeping wreath upon his head.

												    He will tell me, his voice like jewels

												    Dropped into a satin bag,

												    How he has tip-toed after me down the road,

												    His heart made a dark whirlpool with longing for me.

												    Then he will graze me with his hands

												    And I shall be one of the sleeping, silver birds

												    Between the cold waves of his hair, as he tip-toes on.



Women Poems

#######################################################

You will come one day in a waver of love,

												    Tender as dew, impetuous as rain,

												    The tan of the sun will be on your skin,

												    The purr of the breeze in your murmuring speech,

											      You will pose with a hill-flower grace.
												  æ
												  You will come, with your slim, expressive arms,

												    A poise of the head no sculptor has caught

												    And nuances spoken with shoulder and neck,

												    Your face in a pass-and-repass of moods

												    As many as skies in delicate change

												    Of cloud and blue and flimmering sun.
												  æ
												  Yet,

												    You may not come, O girl of a dream,

												    We may but pass as the world goes by

												    And take from a look of eyes into eyes,

											    A film of hope and a memorial day.



Death Poems

#######################################################

There will be rose and rhododendron

												    When you are dead and under ground;

												    Still will be heard from white syringas

											    Heavy with bees, a sunny sound;
												  æ
												  Still will the tamaracks be raining

												    After the rain has ceased, and still

												    Will there be robins in the stubble,

											    Brown sheep upon the warm green hill.
												  æ
												  Spring will not ail nor autumn falter;

												    Nothing will know that you are gone,

												    Saving alone some sullen plough-land

												    None but yourself sets foot upon;
												  æ
								                Saving the may-weed and the pig-weed

												    Nothing will know that you are dead--

												    These, and perhaps a useless wagon

												    Standing beside some tumbled shed.
								                æ
											    Oh, there will pass with your great passing

												    Little of beauty not your own--

												    Only the light from common water,

												    Only the grace from simple stone!



Bird Poems

#######################################################

When the sun rose I was still lying in bed;

												    An early oriole sang on the roof of my house.

												    For a moment I thought of the Royal Park at dawn

												    When the Birds of Spring greeted their Lord from his trees.

												    I remember the days when I served before the Throne

												    Pencil in hand, on duty at the Ch'eng-ming;

												    At the height of spring, when I paused an instant from work,

												    Morning and evening, was this the voice I heard?

												    Now in my exile the oriole sings again

												    In the dreary stillness of Hsí_n-yang town ...

												    The bird's note cannot really have changed;

												    All the difference lies in the listener's heart.

												    If he could but forget that he lives at the World's end,

											    The bird would sing as it sang in the Palace of old.



Love

#######################################################

Were you but lying cold and dead,
And lights were paling out of the West,
You would come hither, and bend your head,
And I would lay my head on your breast;
And you would murmur tender words,
Forgiving me, because you were dead:
Nor would you rise and hasten away,
Though you have the will of wild birds,
But know your hair was bound and wound
About the stars and moon and sun:
O would, beloved, that you lay
Under the dock-leaves in the ground,
While lights were paling one by one.



Love

#######################################################

You dweller in the dark cabin,
To whom the watermelon is always purple,   
Whose garden is wind and moon,

Of the two dreams, night and day,
What lover, what dreamer, would choose   
The one obscured by sleep?

Here is the plantain by your door   
And the best cock of red feather   
That crew before the clocks.

A feme may come, leaf-green,   
Whose coming may give revel   
Beyond revelries of sleep,

Yes, and the blackbird spread its tail,   
So that the sun may speckle,   
While it creaks hail.

You dweller in the dark cabin,   
Rise, since rising will not waken,   
And hail, cry hail, cry hail.



Nature

#######################################################

Her terrace was the sand
And the palms and the twilight.
 
She made of the motions of her wrist
The grandiose gestures
Of her thought.
 
The rumpling of the plumes
Of this creature of the evening
Came to be sleights of sails
Over the sea.
 
And thus she roamed
In the roamings of her fan,

Partaking of the sea,
And of the evening,
As they flowed around
And uttered their subsiding sound.



Love Poems

#######################################################

Miles from you I turn and find you,

												    My beloved. And your gaze

												    And the ripple of your garment

												    And your unexpected ways

												    Of approaching and of speaking

												    And the breath of your hair

												    Are as real to me as rain is

											      Through hot summer air.
												  æ
										        In far companies I meet you

												    Moving natural and clear,

												    Coming toward me in your beauty ...

												    O, be careful, they will hear,

												    They will look at us, these others,

												    They will listen when your hand

												    Touches tumult on my shoulder--

												    Like the surf on the sand!



Dream Poems

#######################################################

In this dream. 
												  æ
                                                You are a painting by Thomas Hart Benton with luxurious black hair and beautiful pale white skin 
                                                æ
										        Asleep. 
										        æ
										        An old hillbilly a mid-west aging Pluto attempts to touch you, looks at you from around the corner in awe and sublime wonder and its obvious and plain to see that he is complete and completely in love with you as you lie in a Cinderella-like ecstasy naked in the middle of a rural Kansas field. Persephone he is softly saying, Persephone. But you cannot hear him speak and he cannot bear to take you into the underground of his place, and his hell. In the background there is a wheat thresher and FDR's America, there is a wide open blue & empty sky full of white clouds and depression era beliefs, and you are Beautiful he murmurs Beautiful because Cupid has overtaken him and you have overtaken all his senses and he cannot ever leave. 
										        æ
										        So in this dream. äó_. you are a painting 
										        æ
												  In this dream you are the spring and the awakening of all ancient wonders and all ancient things, hidden away among the fears and jealousies of all men who cannot see 
												  æ
										        The very things that makes you beautiful 
										        æ
											    äóìYouäó



Love Poems

#######################################################

She had looked for his coming as warriors come,

												    With the clash of arms and the bugle's call;

												    But he came instead with a stealthy tread,

											    Which she did not hear at all.
												  æ
												  She had thought how his armor would blaze in the sun,

												    As he rode like a prince to claim his bride:

												    In the sweet dim light of the falling night

											    She found him at her side.
												  æ
									            She had dreamed how the gaze of his strange, bold eye

												    Would wake her heart to a sudden glow:

												    She found in his face the familiar grace

												    Of a friend she used to know.
									            æ
											    She had dreamed how his coming would stir her soul,

												    As the ocean is stirred by the wild storm's strife:

												    He brought her the balm of a heavenly calm,

												    And a peace which crowned her life.



Children Poems

#######################################################

Tentacles thrust imperceptibly into the future

												    Helplessly sense the fire.

												    A serpentine nerve

												    Impelled to lengthen itself generation after generation

												    Pierces the labyrinth of flames

											      To rose-colored extinction.



God Poems

#######################################################

My Father knows the way, His love

												    Compare with any human love;

												    The best affection man may claim

												    Is as a candle's flickering flame

											    The the world-lighting sun above.
												  æ
												  My Father knows the way, I turn

												    Toward the road I've traveled o'er.

												    O my weak vision, dazzled, blind!

												    My Father knew the way behind,

											    He knows the way before.
												  æ
												  My Father knows the way, His hand

												    Holds tight the reins of chance and fate.

												    No star reveals the road ahead,

												    And yet His child should feel no dread

												    Although the night is late.
												  æ
												  My Father knows the way, His eye

												    Can pierce the gloom that blinds my sight;

												    I hear the rumbling wheels go on,

												    Life's chariot o'er Time's road is drawn,

												    I know that all is right.
												  æ
								                My Father knows the way, His ear

												    Can catch the faintest sound before.

												    He knows where lie the banks so steep,

												    Of Trouble's river, dark and deep,

												    He hears its nearing roar.
								                æ
											    My Father knows the way, His care

												    Shall guard me through the blinding foam;

												    Nor yet forsake me when I see

												    Flash out on Life's dark mystery

												    The beacon light of home.



Night Poems

#######################################################

Below us, the city

												    dreams an illusory path

												    drawn from the watery tints

											      of the mind's paint box.
												  æ
												  Up here,

												    darkness and madness

												    spill out around us

												    through all the dead

												    ends and U-turns,

												    the debris of our lives.
												  æ
												  Should we give up

												    and let the teeth sink in?

												    How far gone are you?
												  æ
								                Should we drive back

												    down or straight off

												    the edge of the world?
								                æ
											    I rev up the engine

												    and head for oblivion.



Women Poems

#######################################################

Your face

												    Was a temple

												    From which your soul

												    Came to me beneath arched brows:

											    And my soul knelt at your feet.
												  æ
										        Then

												    Inadvertently

												    I saw your leg

												    Curved and turned like a bird-song,

												    Dying into ecstatic silence at the garter ...
										        æ
											    Wretched

												    Women!

												    When you are wholly lovely

												    Man cannot forget either of his two afflictions,

												    Soul, or body!



War Poems

#######################################################

Oh stay at home, my lad, and plough

												    The land and not the sea,

												    And leave the soldiers at their drill,

												    And all about the idle hill

											      Shepherd your sheep with me.
												  æ
										        Oh stay with company and mirth

												    And daylight and the air;

												    Too full already is the grave

												    Of fellows that were good and brave

												    And died because they were.



Love Poems

#######################################################

An old silver church in a forest

Is my love for you

The trees around it

Are words that I have stolen from your heart.

An old silver bell, the last smile you gave,

Hangs at the top of my church.

It rings only when you come through the forest

And stand beside it.

And then, it has no need for ringing,

For your voice takes its place.



War Poems

#######################################################

Wandering oversea dreamer,

												    Hunting and hoarse, Oh daughter and mother,

												    Oh daughter of ashes and mother of blood,

												    Child of the hair let down, and tears,

												    Child of the cross in the south

												    And the star in the north,

												    Keeper of Egypt and Russia and France,

												    Keeper of England and Poland and Spain,

												    Make us a song for to-morrow.

												    Make us one new dream, us who forget,

											      Out of the storm let us have one star.
												  æ
												  Struggle, Oh anvils, and help her.

												    Weave with your wool, Oh winds and skies.

												    Let your iron and copper help,

												    Oh dirt of the old dark earth.
												  æ
												  Wandering oversea singer,

												    Singing of ashes and blood,

												    Child of the scars of fire,

												    Make us one new dream, us who forget.

												    Out of the storm let us have one star.



War Poems

#######################################################

Word over all, beautiful as the sky,

												    Beautiful that war and all its deeds of carnage must in time be

												    utterly lost,

												    That the hands of the sisters Death and Night incessantly softly

												    wash again, and ever again, this solid world;

												    For my enemy is dead, a man divine as myself is dead,

												    I look where he lies white-faced and still in the coffin--I draw near,

											      Bend down and touch lightly with my lips the white face in the coffin.



Spring Poems

#######################################################

Sound the flute!

												    Now it's mute!

												    Bird's delight,

												    Day and night,

												    Nightingale,

												    In the dale,

												    Lark in sky,--

												    Merrily,

											      Merrily merrily, to welcome in the year.
												  æ
												   Little boy,

												    Full of joy;

												    Little girl,

												    Sweet and small;

												    Cock does crow,

												    So do you;

												    Merry voice,

												    Infant noise;

												    Merrily, merrily, to welcome in the year.
												  æ
												   Little lamb,

												    Here I am;

												    Come and lick

												    My white neck;

												    Let me pull

												    Your soft wool;

												    Let me kiss

												    Your soft face;

											    Merrily, merrily, to welcome in the year.



Death Poems

#######################################################

I who have lived my life,

												    My years of hot-blood roving, in the sun--

												    Now that my course is run,

												    Is it for me to die

												    Hemmed from the sapphire sky,

												    Scene of my joy and strife--

												    Die here--where the pale chilling blood can just

												    Stain my wan lips

												    As the soul slips

												    Into the darkness? Shall I die in bed,

												    Lost in the shadows of a dimming room,

												    Unutterably sordid? Give me dust

												    Sweeping across the barrens, choking down

												    The feeble death-gasp till the red stars reel

												    In a weird dirge-dance round my sinking head,

												    Rather than see through gloom

												    The specter-pallid nurse in white and gray,

												    The ice-nerved doctor with his black-browed frown,

												    Stealthily steal

												    To fend the last light of the dying day

												    With close-drawn blinds from my light-thirsty eyes--

												    Ye sunset skies!

												    I used to know your splendor! Let me die

												    Like any dog, but let it be away

											      Under the open sky!
												  æ
										        Give me to die like a beast, afar, alone

												    With but the hawk and crow

												    To watch beside me while I cast my soul,

												    And but the sky to know

												    What my racked lips have uttered, what last groan,

												    Or curse or prayer, I breathed to heaven above--

												    And this the whole

												    Boon that I ask of you--to split in twain

												    With your wild night-winds, for the ancient love

												    I bore you, O ye Sunset-flames, the smother

												    That rides like some dire curse upon my chest,

												    And let me feel again

												    The blessed western breeze--my restless brother

												    On many an endless road--that knew me best

												    Of all the winds that sweep around the world.

												    --Give me to drown, in the dark, where, tempest-hurled,

												    The black ship wavers down through soundless sea;

												    Give me to die in a good fight, foul or fair,

												    With but a heart to stab, a throat to clutch,

												    And once again to see

												    That gay red haze of madness veil my sight--

												    To feel the hot breath and the blood-stiff hair--

												    I ask too much?

												    I am a beast, they say?

												    Then let me die,

												    By all the gods, just as a beast should die--

												    Out in the flaming sunset, far away

												    Under the open sky!



Christmas Poems

#######################################################

It was a gleaner in the fields--

												    The fields gleaned long ago:

												    The evening wind swept down from heights

											    Already brushed with snow.
												  æ
												  The gleaner turned to right, to left,

												    With searching steps forlorn;

												    The stubble-blade beneath her feet

											    Was sharp as any thorn.
												  æ
												  But as she stooped, and as she searched,

												    Half blind with gathering tears,

												    Beside her in the field stood One

												    Whose voice beguiled her fears:
												  æ
												  "What seek ye here, this bitter eve,

												    The harvest long gone by?"

												    She lifted up her weary face,

												    She answered with a sigh:
												  æ
												  "I seek but some few heads of wheat

												    To nail against the wall,

												    To feed at morn the blessed birds,

												    When with loud chirps they call.
												  æ
												  "Poor ever have I been, God knows!

												    Yet ne'er so poor before,

												    But they might taste their glad Noíl

		                      Beside my cottage door."
												  æ
												  Then answer made that Presence sweet,

												    "Go home, and trust right well

												    The birds besdie your cottage door

											    Shall find their glad Noíl."
												  æ
								                And so it was--from soundest sleep

												    The gleaner woke at morn,

												    To see, nailed up beside her door,

												    A sheaf of golden corn!
								                æ
											    And thereupon the birds did feast--

												    The birds from far and wide:

												    All know it was Our Lord Himself

												    That goodly sheaf supplied!



Love Poems

#######################################################

HER tawny eyes are onyx of thoughtlessness,

												    Hardened they are like gems in ancient modesty;

												    Yea, and her mouth's prudent and crude caress

											      Means even less than her many words to me.
												  æ
												  Though her kiss betrays me also this, this only

												    Consolation, that in her lips her blood at climax clips

												    Two wild, dumb paws in anguish on the lonely

												    Fruit of my heart, ere down, rebuked, it slips.
												  æ
												  I know from her hardened lips that still her heart is

												    Hungry for me, yet if I put my hand in her breast

												    She puts me away, like a saleswoman whose mart is

												    Endangered by the pilferer on his quest.
												  æ
												  But her hands are still the woman, the large, strong hands

												    Heavier than mine, yet like leverets caught in steel

												    When I hold them; my still soul understands

												    Their dumb confession of what her sort must feel.
												  æ
												  For never her hands come nigh me but they lift

												    Like heavy birds from the morning stubble, to settle

												    Upon me like sleeping birds, like birds that shift

												    Uneasily in their sleep, disturbing my mettle.
												  æ
												  How caressingly she lays her hand on my knee,

												    How strangely she tries to disown it, as it sinks

												    In my flesh and bone and forages into me,

												    How it stirs like a subtle stoat, whatever she thinks!
												  æ
												  And often I see her clench her fingers tight

												    And thrust her fists suppressed in the folds of her skirt;

												    And sometimes, how she grasps her arms with her bright

												    Big hands, as if surely her arms did hurt.
												  æ
												  And I have seen her stand all unaware

												    Pressing her spread hands over her breasts, as she

												    Would crush their mounds on her heart, to kill in there

												    The pain that is her simple ache for me.
												  æ
												  Her strong hands take my part, the part of a man

												    To her; she crushes them into her bosom deep

												    Where I should lie, and with her own strong span

												    Closes her arms, that should fold me in sleep.
												  æ
												  Ah, and she puts her hands upon the wall,

												    Presses them there, and kisses her bright hands,

												    Then lets her black hair loose, the darkness fall

												    About her from her maiden-folded bands.
												  æ
												  And sits in her own dark night of her bitter hair

												    Dreaming--God knows of what, for to me she's the same

												    Betrothed young lady who loves me, and takes care

											    Of her womanly virtue and of my good name.



Children Poems

#######################################################

The little boy lost in the lonely fen,

												    Led by the wandering light,

												    Began to cry, but God, ever nigh,

											      Appeared like his father, in white.
												  æ
												   He kissed the child, and by the hand led,

												    And to his mother brought,

												    Who in sorrow pale, through the lonely dale,

											    The little boy weeping sought.



Mythological Poems

#######################################################

Within the labyrinth's depths the Minotaur,

												    Slain by the sword she gave, lay stark and dead,

												    And with his finger following her thread

												    He issued forth to see the heavens once more.

												    Then Theseus swiftly from the hated shore

												    With Ariadne on his bosom fled,

												    Still hearing, as toward Naxos on they sped,

												    King Minos' cries above the ocean's roar.

												    Deep-nested in love's softest down they lay

												    When she to him: "Through me alone thy way

												    To century-sounding fame has now been won;

												    And yet I fear;--Oh, swear we shall not part!"--

												    "By Aphrodite do I swear, sweetheart!" ...

											      Then rose portentous cloud and hid the sun.



Love Poems

#######################################################

Sometimes a mist of sunlight across a stranger's hair,

												    Sometimes the vague expression upon a sranger's face,

												    Can make me feel your presence--can fill a lonely place

												    With dreams of life half realized. Faint music through the air

												    Can make me hear your foot-fall, again, upon the stair--

												    Sometimes a dancer moving with quite unconscious grace,

												    Can make my pulse beat faster; and for a breathless space

											      Can make me turn, expecting to find you standing there!
												  æ
												  You have not gone! The passing of every empty day

												    Has only brought you nearer. Those things that were a part

												    Of all we planned together are bits of you that stay,

												    To bruise my soul as sharply as any flame-tipped dart.

												    Ah, time may hold its healing--but years that pass away

											    Cannot erase the writing you traced upon my heart!



Butterfly Poems

#######################################################

I've watch'd you now a full half-hour,

												    Self-poised upon that yellow flower;

												    And, little Butterfly! indeed

												    I know not if you sleep or feed.

												    How motionless!äóînot frozen seas

												    More motionless! and then

												    What joy awaits you, when the breeze

												    Hath found you out among the trees,

											      And calls you forth again!
												  æ
												  This plot of orchard-ground is ours;

												    My trees they are, my Sister's flowers;

												    Here rest your wings when they are weary;

												    Here lodge as in a sanctuary!

												    Come often to us, fear no wrong;

												    Sit near us on the bough!

												    We'll talk of sunshine and of song,

												    And summer days, when we were young;

												    Sweet childish days, that were as long

											    As twenty days are now.



Religious Poems

#######################################################

the cycle cuts both ways

												    and the haze that lays upon the sky

												    falls in cascades unafraid of your perceptions.

												    conceptions, missed and made, kissed and played

											    for a fool, held in continuous catalepsies.
												  æ
												  the promise makes a mark.

												    stark realizations evoking amotations

												    in the mouths of children reaching for the golden apples,

												    sold and consumed in fists fitful and frail.

											    the sail of the horizon turns away, if only in the dimlight.
												  æ
										        the riddle takes it's toll.

												    soul food for the role we all play in the dance.

												    chances exchanged in dances made to execute a single turn.

												    and we burn.  oh we burn with incandescent passions,

												    fashioned in the image of our gods, however we build them.
										        æ
											    the memory remains to tell.

												    and we will share it when we dare again to feel something

												    less than the most that we toast our fall over, the wine

												    of wisdom running across tongues made numb with the spices

												    that twice as oft as not have burnt our lips for a draught of heaven.



Flower Poems

#######################################################

LOVERS, forget your love, 

												    And list to the love of these, 

												    She a window flower, 

												    And he a winter breeze. 

												    When the frosty window veil 

												    Was melted down at noon, 

												    And the cagíÂd yellow bird 

												    Hung over her in tune, 

												    He marked her through the pane, 

												    He could not help but mark, 

												    And only passed her by, 

												    To come again at dark. 

												    He was a winter wind, 

												    Concerned with ice and snow, 

												    Dead weeds and unmated birds, 

												    And little of love could know. 

												    But he sighed upon the sill, 

												    He gave the sash a shake, 

												    As witness all within 

												    Who lay that night awake. 

												    Perchance he half prevailed 

												    To win her for the flight 

												    From the firelit looking-glass 

												    And warm stove-window light. 

												    But the flower leaned aside 

												    And thought of naught to say, 

												    And morning found the breeze 

											      A hundred miles away.
