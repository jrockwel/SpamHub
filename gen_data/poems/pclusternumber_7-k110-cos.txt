They'd hoped he'd be back for Christmas -

												    the lights shining down on him, the tree

												    somehow shielding off the horror. A break.

												    The family hadn't seen him as a soldier,

												    in his uniform, among harvested paddocks,

											      the dried stubble that pricked your legs.
												  æ
										        Arriving home, he said Merry Christmas,

												    hugged people and slapped them on the back.

												    Wandered about the place, eyes crinkled

												    with strain, lines dug

												    into his forehead. So young, he seemed

												    to be either laughing or very sad

												    as though, in between,

												    there was nothing.



Summer Poems

#######################################################

'Tis fine to play

												    In the fragrant hay,

												    And romp on the golden load;

												    To ride old Jack

												    To the barn and back,

												    Or tramp by a shady road.

												    To pause and drink,

												    At a mossy brink;

												    Ah, that is the best of joy,

												    And so I say

												    On a summer's day,

											    What's so fine as being a boy? Ha, ha!
												  æ
										        With line and hook

												    By a babbling brook,

												    The fisherman's sport we ply;

												    And list the song

												    Of the feathered throng

												    That flit in the branches nigh.
										        æ
											    At last we strip

												    For a quiet dip;

												    Ah, that is the best of joy.

												    For this I say

												    On a summer's day,

												    What's so fine as being a boy? Ha, ha!

From Cold Comfort
											    
												  He drives home

												    thru the black trees

												    with a poem

												    about me that will

												    make him famous

												    starting in his

												    fingers.  He wishes 

												    the wheel was his

												    Olympia typewriter.

												    He needs to get my

												    hair where he can

												    touch it on the long

												    drive thru the pine

												    trees, my musk still

												    drenching the car.

												    I want to read

												    this poem almost as 

												    much, dazed, the

												    night's performance

												    has sucked me flat

												    and pale as an empty

												    sheet of non erasable

												    bond, has pulled

												    all color, all the

												    wet moist verbs

												    out the way he took

												    the stories I told

												    and made them in

												    to his own surreal 

												    dreams.  Even my

												    leaves and branches

												    became the green

												    arms of a child.

												    My mouth is dry, I

												    need to have his

												    poem where my clove

												    nipples press into his

												    blue striped cotton

												    smelling of sun and

												    wind in the pine

												    trees, a mirror that

												    will reflect my dark

												    eyes.  I need this as

												    much as he needs

												    to invent me to

												    become himself.



Nature

#######################################################

Man, looking into the sea
taking the view from those who have as much right to it as you have it to yourself
it is human nature to stand in the middle of a thing
but you cannot stand in the middle of this:
the sea has nothing to give but a well excavated grave.
The firs stand in a processioneach with an emerald turkey-foot at the top
reserved as their contours, saying nothing;
repression, however, is not the most obvious characteristic of the sea;
the sea is a collector, quick to return a rapacious look.
There are others besides you who have worn that look
whose expression is no longer a protest; the fish no longer investigate them
for their bones have not lasted;
men lower nets, unconscious of the fact that they are desecrating a grave,
and row quickly awaythe blades of the oars   
moving together like the feet of water-spiders as if there were no such thing as death.
The wrinkles progress upon themselves in a phalanxbeautiful under networks of foam,
and fade breathlessly while the sea rustles in and out of the seaweed;
the birds swim through the air at top speed, emitting cat-calls as heretofore
the tortoise-shell scourges about the feet of the cliffs, in motion beneath them
and the ocean, under the pulsation of light-houses and noise of bell-buoys,
advances as usual, looking as if it were not that ocean in which dropped things are bound to sink
in which if they turn and twist, it is neither with volition nor consciousness.

War Poems

#######################################################

Benedict Arnold at the Battle of Stillwater, 1777
											    
												  Ah, you mistake me, comrades, to think that my heart is steel!

												    Cased in a cold endurance, nor pleasure nor pain to feel;

												    Cold as I am in my manner, yet over these cheeks so seared

											      Teardrops have fallen in torrents, thrice since my chin grew beard.
												  æ
												  Thrice since my chin was bearded I suffered the tears to fall;

												    Benedict Arnold, the traitor, he was the cause of them all!

												    Once, when he carried Stillwater, proud of his valor, I cried;

												    Then, with my rage at his treason--with pity when Andrí© died.
												  æ
												  Benedict Arnold, the traitor, sank deep in the pit of shame,

												    Bartered for vengeance his honor, blackened for profit his fame;

												    Yet never a gallanter soldier, whatever his after crime,

												    Fought on the red field of honor than he in his early time.
												  æ
												  Ah, I remember Stillwater, as it were yesterday!

												    Then first I shouldered a firelock, and set out the foemen to slay.

												    The country was up all around us, racing and chasing Burgoyne,

												    And I had gone out with my neighbors, Gates and his forces to join.
												  æ
												  Marched we with Poor and with Learned, ready and eager to fight;

												    There stood the foemen before us, cannon and men on the height;

												    Onward we trod with no shouting, forbidden to fire till the word;

												    As silent their long line of scarlet--not one of them whispered or stirred.
												  æ
												  Suddenly, then, from among them smoke rose and spread on the breeze;

												    Grapeshot flew over us sharply, cutting the limbs from the trees;

												    But onward we pressed till the order of Cilley fell full on the ear;

												    Then we leveled our pieces and fired them, and rushed up the slope with a cheer.
												  æ
												  Fiercely we charged on their center, and beat back the stout grenadiers,

												    And wounded the brave Major Ackland, and grappled the swart cannoneers;

												    Five times we captured their cannons, and five times they took them again;

												    But the sixth time we had them we kept them, and with them a share of their men.
												  æ
												  Our colonel who led us dismounted, high on a cannon he sprang;

												    Over the noise of our shouting clearly his joyous words rang;

												    "These are our own brazen beauties! Here to America's cause

												    I dedicate each, and to freedom!--foes to King George and his laws!"
												  æ
												  Worn as we were with the struggle, wounded and bleeding and sore,

												    Some stood all pale and exhausted; some lay there stiff in their gore;

												    And round through the mass went a murmur, that grew to a whispering clear,

												    And then to reproaches outspoken--"If General Arnold were here!"
												  æ
												  For Gates, in his folly and envy, had given the chief no command,

												    And far in the rear some had seen him horseless and moodily stand,

												    Knitting his forehead in anger, gnawing his red lip in pain,

												    Fretting himself like a bloodhound held back from his prey by a chain.
												  æ
												  Hark, at our right there is cheering! there is the ruffle of drums!

												    Here is the well-known brown charger! Spurring it madly he comes!

												    Learned's brigade have espied him, rending the air with a cheer;

												    Woe to the terrified foeman, now that our leader is here!
												  æ
												  Piercing the tumult behind him, Armstrong is out on his track;

												    Gates has dispatched his lieutenant to summon the fugitive back.

												    Armstrong might summon the tempest, order the whirlwind to stay,

												    Issue commands to the earthquake--would they the mandate obey?
												  æ
												  Wounds, they were healed in a moment! weariness instantly gone!

												    Forward he pointed his saber--led us, not ordered us on.

												    Down on the Hessians we thundered, he, like a madman ahead;

												    Vainly they strove to withstand us; raging, they shivered and fled.
												  æ
												  On to their earthworks we drove them, shaking with ire and dismay;

												    There they made stand with a purpose to beat back the tide of the day.

												    Onward we followed, then faltered; deadly their balls whistled free.

												    Where was our death-daring leader? Arnold, our hope, where was he?
												  æ
												  He? He was everywhere riding! hither and thither his form,

												    On the brown charger careering, showed us the path of the storm;

												    Over the roar of the cannon, over the musketry's crash,

												    Sounded his voice, while his saber lit up the way with its flash.
												  æ
												  Throwing quick glances around him, reining a moment his steed--

												    "Brooks, that redoubt!" was his order; "let the rest follow my lead!

												    Mark where the smoke-cloud is parting! see where the gun-barrels glance!

												    Livingston, forward! On, Wesson, charge them! Let Morgan advance!"
												  æ
												  "Forward!" he shouted, and, spurring on through the sally-port then,

												    Fell sword in hand on the Hessians, closely behind him our men.

												    Back shrank the foemen in terror; off went their forces pellmell,

												    Firing one Parthian volley; struck by it, Arnold, he fell.
												  æ
												  Ours was the day. Up we raised him; spurted the blood from his knee--

												    "Take my cravat, boys, and bind it; I am not dead yet," said he.

												    "What! did you follow me, Armstrong? Pray, do you think it quite right,

												    Leaving your duties out yonder, to risk your dear self in the fight?"
												  æ
												  "General Gates sent his orders"--faltering the aid-de-camp spoke--

												    "You're to return, lest some rashness--" Fiercely the speech Arnold broke:

												    "Rashness! Why, yes, tell the general the rashness he dreaded is done!

												    Tell him his kinsfolk are beaten! tell him the battle is won!"
												  æ
												  Oh, that a soldier so glorious, ever victorious in fight,

												    Passed from a daylight of honor into the terrible night!--

												    Fell as the mighty archangel, ere the earth glowed in space, fell--

											    Fell from the patriot's heaven down to the loyalist's hell!

Its eyes are gray;

												    Its hair is either brown

												    Or black;

												    And, strange to say,

											    Its dresses button down the back!
												  æ
												  It wears a plume

												    That loves to frisk around 

												    My ear.

												    It crowds the room

												    With cushions in a mound

											    And queer.
												  æ
												  Old rugs and lamps

												    In corners íæ la Turque

												    And things.

												    It steals my stamps,

												    And when I want to work

											    It sings!
												  æ
												  It rides and skates--

												    But then it comes and fills

												    My walls

												    With plaques and plates

												    And keeps me paying bills

											    And calls.
												  æ
										        It's firm; and if

												    I should my many woes

												    Deplore,

												    'Twould only sniff

												    And perk its little nose

												    Some more.
										        æ
											    It's bright, though small;

												    Its name, you may have guessed,

												    Is "Wife."

												    But, after all,

												    It gives a wondrous zest

												    To life!



Narrative Poems

#######################################################

There once was a man whom the gods didn't love,

												    And a disagreeable man was he.

												    He loathed his neighbours, and his neighbours hated him,

											      And he cursed eternally.
												  æ
												  He damned the sun, and he damned the stars,

												    And he blasted the winds in the sky.

												    He sent to Hell every green, growing thing,

												    And he raved at the birds as they fly.
												  æ
												  His oaths were many, and his range was wide,

												    He swore in fancy ways;

												    But his meaning was plain:  that no created thing

												    Was other than a hurt to his gaze.
												  æ
												  He dwelt all alone, underneath a leaning hill,

												    And windows toward the hill there were none,

												    And on the other side they were white-washed thick,

												    To keep out every spark of the sun.
												  æ
												  When he went to market he walked all the way

												    Blaspheming at the path he trod.

												    He cursed at those he bought of, and swore at those he sold to,

												    By all the names he knew of God.
												  æ
												  For his heart was soured in his weary old hide,

												    And his hopes had curdled in his breast.

												    His friend had been untrue, and his love had thrown him over

												    For the chinking money-bags she liked best.
												  æ
												  The rats had devoured the contents of his grain-bin,

												    The deer had trampled on his corn,

												    His brook had shrivelled in a summer drought,

												    And his sheep had died unshorn.
												  æ
												  His hens wouldn't lay, and his cow broke loose,

												    And his old horse perished of a colic.

												    In the loft his wheat-bags were nibbled into holes

												    By little, glutton mice on a frolic.
												  æ
												  So he slowly lost all he ever had,

												    And the blood in his body dried.

												    Shrunken and mean he still lived on,

												    And cursed that future which had lied.
												  æ
												  One day he was digging, a spade or two,

												    As his aching back could lift,

												    When he saw something glisten at the bottom of the trench,

												    And to get it out he made great shift.
												  æ
												  So he dug, and he delved, with care and pain,

												    And the veins in his forehead stood taut.

												    At the end of an hour, when every bone cracked,

												    He gathered up what he had sought.
												  æ
												  A dim old vase of crusted glass,

												    Prismed while it lay buried deep.

												    Shifting reds and greens, like a pigeon's neck,

												    At the touch of the sun began to leap.
												  æ
												  It was dull in the tree-shade, but glowing in the light;

												    Flashing like an opal-stone,

												    Carved into a flagon; and the colours glanced and ran,

												    Where at first there had seemed to be none.
												  æ
												  It had handles on each side to bear it up,

												    And a belly for the gurgling wine.

												    Its neck was slender, and its mouth was wide,

												    And its lip was curled and fine.
												  æ
												  The old man saw it in the sun's bright stare

												    And the colours started up through the crust,

												    And he who had cursed at the yellow sun

												    Held the flask to it and wiped away the dust.
												  æ
												  And he bore the flask to the brightest spot,

												    Where the shadow of the hill fell clear;

												    And he turned the flask, and he looked at the flask,

												    And the sun shone without his sneer.
												  æ
												  Then he carried it home, and put it on a shelf,

												    But it was only grey in the gloom.

												    So he fetched a pail, and a bit of cloth,

												    And he went outside with a broom.
												  æ
												  And he washed his windows just to let the sun

												    Lie upon his new-found vase;

												    And when evening came, he moved it down

												    And put it on a table near the place
												  æ
												  Where a candle fluttered in a draught from the door.

												    The old man forgot to swear,

												    Watching its shadow grown a mammoth size,

												    Dancing in the kitchen there.
												  æ
												  He forgot to revile the sun next morning

												    When he found his vase afire in its light.

												    And he carried it out of the house that day,

												    And kept it close beside him until night.
												  æ
												  And so it happened from day to day.

												    The old man fed his life

												    On the beauty of his vase, on its perfect shape.

												    And his soul forgot its former strife.
												  æ
												  And the village-folk came and begged to see

												    The flagon which was dug from the ground.

												    And the old man never thought of an oath, in his joy

												    At showing what he had found.
												  æ
												  One day the master of the village school

												    Passed him as he stooped at toil,

												    Hoeing for a bean-row, and at his side

												    Was the vase, on the turned-up soil.
												  æ
												  "My friend," said the schoolmaster, pompous and kind,

												    "That's a valuable thing you have there,

												    But it might get broken out of doors,

												    It should meet with the utmost care.
												  æ
												  What are you doing with it out here?"

												    "Why, Sir," said the poor old man,

												    "I like to have it about, do you see?

												    To be with it all I can."
												  æ
												  "You will smash it," said the schoolmaster, sternly right,

												    "Mark my words and see!"

												    And he walked away, while the old man looked

												    At his treasure despondingly.
												  æ
												  Then he smiled to himself, for it was his!

												    He had toiled for it, and now he cared.

												    Yes! loved its shape, and its subtle, swift hues,

												    Which his own hard work had bared.
												  æ
												  He would carry it round with him everywhere,

												    As it gave him joy to do.

												    A fragile vase should not stand in a bean-row!

												    Who would dare to say so?  Who?
												  æ
												  Then his heart was rested, and his fears gave way,

												    And he bent to his hoe again. . . .

												    A clod rolled down, and his foot slipped back,

												    And he lurched with a cry of pain.
												  æ
												  For the blade of the hoe crashed into glass,

												    And the vase fell to iridescent sherds.

												    The old man's body heaved with slow, dry sobs.

												    He did not curse, he had no words.
												  æ
												  He gathered the fragments, one by one,

												    And his fingers were cut and torn.

												    Then he made a hole in the very place

												    Whence the beautiful vase had been borne.
												  æ
												  He covered the hole, and he patted it down,

												    Then he hobbled to his house and shut the door.

												    He tore up his coat and nailed it at the windows

												    That no beam of light should cross the floor.
												  æ
												  He sat down in front of the empty hearth,

												    And he neither ate nor drank.

												    In three days they found him, dead and cold,

											    And they said:  "What a queer old crank!"

A Reminiscence: 1893
											    
												  She wore a new 'terra-cotta' dress,

												    And we stayed, because of the pelting storm,

												    Within the hansom's dry recess,

												    Though the horse had stopped; yea, motionless

												    We sat on, snug and warm.
												  æ
												  Then the downpour ceased, to my sharp sad pain,

												    And the glass that had screened our forms before

												    Flew up, and out she sprang to her door:

												    I should have kissed her if the rain

											    Had lasted a minute more.

Once in a manäó»s life 

												    heäó»s seen a sexy woman

												  Thereäó»s something in him that canäó»t be controlled

												  A herd of elephants

SICUT PATRIBUS, SIT DEUS NOBIS
											    
												  The rocky nook with hilltops three

												    Looked eastward from the farms,

												    And twice each day the flowing sea

												    Took Boston in its arms;

												    The men of yore were stout and poor,

												    And sailed for bread to every shore.
												  æ
												  And where they went on trade intent

												    They did what freemen can,

												    Their dauntless ways did all men praise,

												    The merchant was a man.

												    The world was made for honest trade,--

												    To plant and eat be none afraid.
												  æ
												  The waves that rocked them on the deep

												    To them their secret told;

												    Said the winds that sung the lads to sleep,

												    'Like us be free and bold!'

												    The honest waves refused to slaves

												    The empire of the ocean caves.
												  æ
												  Old Europe groans with palaces,

												    Has lords enough and more;--

												    We plant and build by foaming seas

												    A city of the poor;--

												    For day by day could Boston Bay

												    Their honest labor overpay.
												  æ
												  We grant no dukedoms to the few,

												    We hold like rights, and shall;--

												    Equal on Sunday in the pew,

												    On Monday in the mall,

												    For what avail the plough or sail,

												    Or land or life, if freedom fail?
												  æ
												  The noble craftsman we promote,

												    Disown the knave and fool;

												    Each honest man shall have his vote,

												    Each child shall have his school.

												    A union then of honest men,

												    Or union never more again.
												  æ
												  The wild rose and the barberry thorn

												    Hung out their summer pride,

												    Where now on heated pavements worn

												    The feet of millions stride.
												  æ
												  Fair rose the planted hills behind

												    The good town on the bay,

												    And where the western hills declined

												    The prairie stretched away.
												  æ
												  What care though rival cities soar

												    Along the stormy coast,

												    Penn's town, New York and Baltimore,

												    If Boston knew the most!
												  æ
												  They laughed to know the world so wide;

												    The mountains said, 'Good-day!

												    We greet you well, you Saxon men,

												    Up with your towns and stay!'

												    The world was made for honest trade,--

												    To plant and eat be none afraid.
												  æ
												  'For you,' they said, 'no barriers be,

												    For you no sluggard rest;

												    Each street leads downward to the sea,

												    Or landward to the west.'
												  æ
												  O happy town beside the sea,

												    Whose roads lead everywhere to all;

												    Than thine no deeper moat can be,

												    No stouter fence, no steeper wall!
												  æ
												  Bad news from George on the English throne;

												    'You are thriving well,' said he;

												    'Now by these presents be it known

												    You shall pay us a tax on tea;

												    'Tis very small,--no load at all,--

												    Honor enough that we send the call.
												  æ
												  'Not so,' said Boston, 'good my lord,

												    We pay your governors here

												    Abundant for their bed and board,

												    Six thousand pounds a year.

												    (Your Highness knows our homely word)

												    Millions for self-government,

												    But for tribute never a cent.'
												  æ
												  The cargo came! and who could blame

												    If Indians seized the tea,

												    And, chest by chest, let down the same,

												    Into the laughing sea?

												    For what avail the plough or sail,

												    Or land or life, if freedom fail?
												  æ
												  The townsmen braved the English king,

												    Found friendship in the French,

												    And honor joined the patriot ring

												    Low on their wooden bench.
												  æ
												  O bounteous seas that never fail!

												    O day remembered yet!

												    O happy port that spied the sail

												    Which wafted Lafayette!

												    Pole-star of light in Europe's night,

												    That never faltered from the right.
												  æ
												  Kings shook with fear, old empires crave

												    The secret force to find

												    Which fired the little State to save

												    The rights of all mankind.
												  æ
												  But right is might through all the world;

												    Province to province faithful clung,

												    Through good and ill the war-bolt hurled,

												    Till Freedom cheered and joy-bells rung.
												  æ
												  The sea returning day by day

												    Restores the world-wide mart;

												    So let each dweller on the Bay

												    Fold Boston in his heart,

												    Till these echoes be choked with snows,

												    Or over the town blue ocean flows.
												  æ
												  Let the blood of her hundred thousands

												    Throb in each manly vein;

												    And the wits of all her wisest,

												    Make sunshine in her brain.

												    For you can teach the lightning speech,

												    And round the globe your voices reach.
												  æ
												  And each shall care for other,

												    And each to each shall bend,

												    To the poor a noble brother,

												    To the good an equal friend.
												  æ
												  A blessing through the ages thus

												    Shield all thy roofs and towers!

												    GOD WITH THE FATHERS, SO WITH US,

											    Thou darling town of ours!



Love Poems

from Lipstick
										        
												  I ask you, how the hibernating bulb

												    knows when to jerk awake?

												    Pinioned in the ice-dark earth

												    perpetual night of wet and cold

												    How does it know the time has come

												    to push the bleached blind maggoty shoot

												    out into the stone-frost dirt

											    on cue to flower on April 23rd?
												  æ
										        I dare you, take a bulb and strip away

												    its glossy, coppery paper shell

												    the onion-like white folds on folds

												    and show me where it keeps the clock

												    or microchip which tells it when to start

												    so it will flower to the day with its companions

												    however chill and damp the spring.

												    One laggard never oversleeps and pops up in September.
										        æ
											    I defy you, take the spiralling DNA of me

												    the pumping, wooshing ventricles,

												    the zing-charged porridge in my head,

												    and show me where I keep the love for you

												    that will outlast my life.



Wedding Poems

#######################################################

I never saw the morning till today;

												    I never knew how soon night went away--

												    Day merely came a regular event;

											      Night merely went ...
												  æ
										        Now day and night are chariots for me,

												    Since I have learned their mystery from you:

												    Day holding one and moving solemnly--

												    Night holding two.



New York Poems

#######################################################

1
											    
												  												    Flood-tide below me! I see you face to face!

												    Clouds of the west--sun there half an hour high--I see you also face

												    to face.
												  æ
												  Crowds of men and women attired in the usual costumes, how curious

												    you are to me!

												    On the ferry-boats the hundreds and hundreds that cross, returning

												    home, are more curious to me than you suppose,

												    And you that shall cross from shore to shore years hence are more

												    to me, and more in my meditations, than you might suppose.
											    
												     2
											    
												  												    The impalpable sustenance of me from all things at all hours of the day,

												    The simple, compact, well-join'd scheme, myself disintegrated, every

												    one disintegrated yet part of the scheme,

												    The similitudes of the past and those of the future,

												    The glories strung like beads on my smallest sights and hearings, on

												    the walk in the street and the passage over the river,

												    The current rushing so swiftly and swimming with me far away,

												    The others that are to follow me, the ties between me and them,

												    The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others.
												  æ
												  Others will enter the gates of the ferry and cross from shore to shore,

												    Others will watch the run of the flood-tide,

												    Others will see the shipping of Manhattan north and west, and the

												    heights of Brooklyn to the south and east,

												    Others will see the islands large and small;

												    Fifty years hence, others will see them as they cross, the sun half

												    an hour high,

												    A hundred years hence, or ever so many hundred years hence, others

												    will see them,

												    Will enjoy the sunset, the pouring-in of the flood-tide, the

												    falling-back to the sea of the ebb-tide.
											    
												     3
											    
												  												    It avails not, time nor place--distance avails not,

												    I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many

												    generations hence,

												    Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt,

												    Just as any of you is one of a living crowd, I was one of a crowd,

												    Just as you are refresh'd by the gladness of the river and the

												    bright flow, I was refresh'd,

												    Just as you stand and lean on the rail, yet hurry with the swift

												    current, I stood yet was hurried,

												    Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the

												    thick-stemm'd pipes of steamboats, I look'd.
												  æ
												  I too many and many a time cross'd the river of old,

												    Watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them high in the air

												    floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,

												    Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left

												    the rest in strong shadow,

												    Saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south,

												    Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,

												    Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,

												    Look'd at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my

												    head in the sunlit water,

												    Look'd on the haze on the hills southward and south-westward,

												    Look'd on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,

												    Look'd toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving,

												    Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,

												    Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor,

												    The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars,

												    The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender

												    serpentine pennants,

												    The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilothouses,

												    The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels,

												    The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset,

												    The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the

												    frolic-some crests and glistening,

												    The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the

												    granite storehouses by the docks,

												    On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank'd on

												    each side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated lighter,

												    On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning

												    high and glaringly into the night,

												    Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow

												    light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets.
											    
												     4
											    
												  												    These and all else were to me the same as they are to you,

												    I loved well those cities, loved well the stately and rapid river,

												    The men and women I saw were all near to me,

												    Others the same--others who look back on me because I look'd forward

												    to them,

												    (The time will come, though I stop here to-day and to-night.)
											    
												     5
											    
												  												    What is it then between us?

												    What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?
												  æ
												  Whatever it is, it avails not--distance avails not, and place avails not,

												    I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine,

												    I too walk'd the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in the

												    waters around it,

												    I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,

												    In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me,

												    In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me,

												    I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution,

												    I too had receiv'd identity by my body,

												    That I was I knew was of my body, and what I should be I knew I

												    should be of my body.
											    
												     6
											    
												  												    It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,

												    The dark threw its patches down upon me also,

												    The best I had done seem'd to me blank and suspicious,

												    My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?

												    Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil,

												    I am he who knew what it was to be evil,

												    I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,

												    Blabb'd, blush'd, resented, lied, stole, grudg'd,

												    Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,

												    Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant,

												    The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me.

												    The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting,
												  æ
												  Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting,

												    Was one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest,

												    Was call'd by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as

												    they saw me approaching or passing,

												    Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of

												    their flesh against me as I sat,

												    Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet

												    never told them a word,

												    Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping,

												    Play'd the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,

												    The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like,

												    Or as small as we like, or both great and small.
											    
												     7
											    
												  												    Closer yet I approach you,

												    What thought you have of me now, I had as much of you--I laid in my

												    stores in advance,

												    I consider'd long and seriously of you before you were born.
												  æ
												  Who was to know what should come home to me?

												    Who knows but I am enjoying this?

												    Who knows, for all the distance, but I am as good as looking at you

												    now, for all you cannot see me?
											    
												     8
											    
												  												    Ah, what can ever be more stately and admirable to me than

												    mast-hemm'd Manhattan?

												    River and sunset and scallop-edg'd waves of flood-tide?

												    The sea-gulls oscillating their bodies, the hay-boat in the

												    twilight, and the belated lighter?

												    What gods can exceed these that clasp me by the hand, and with voices I

												    love call me promptly and loudly by my nighest name as approach?

												    What is more subtle than this which ties me to the woman or man that

												    looks in my face?

												    Which fuses me into you now, and pours my meaning into you?
												  æ
												  We understand then do we not?

												    What I promis'd without mentioning it, have you not accepted?

												    What the study could not teach--what the preaching could not

												    accomplish is accomplish'd, is it not?
											    
												     9
											    
												  												    Flow on, river! flow with the flood-tide, and ebb with the ebb-tide!

												    Frolic on, crested and scallop-edg'd waves!

												    Gorgeous clouds of the sunset! drench with your splendor me, or the

												    men and women generations after me!

												    Cross from shore to shore, countless crowds of passengers!

												    Stand up, tall masts of Mannahatta! stand up, beautiful hills of Brooklyn!

												    Throb, baffled and curious brain! throw out questions and answers!

												    Suspend here and everywhere, eternal float of solution!

												    Gaze, loving and thirsting eyes, in the house or street or public assembly!

												    Sound out, voices of young men! loudly and musically call me by my

												    nighest name!

												    Live, old life! play the part that looks back on the actor or actress!

												    Play the old role, the role that is great or small according as one

												    makes it!

												    Consider, you who peruse me, whether I may not in unknown ways be

												    looking upon you;

												    Be firm, rail over the river, to support those who lean idly, yet

												    haste with the hasting current;

												    Fly on, sea-birds! fly sideways, or wheel in large circles high in the air;

												    Receive the summer sky, you water, and faithfully hold it till all

												    downcast eyes have time to take it from you!

												    Diverge, fine spokes of light, from the shape of my head, or any

												    one's head, in the sunlit water!

												    Come on, ships from the lower bay! pass up or down, white-sail'd

												    schooners, sloops, lighters!

												    Flaunt away, flags of all nations! be duly lower'd at sunset!

												    Burn high your fires, foundry chimneys! cast black shadows at

												    nightfall! cast red and yellow light over the tops of the houses!

												    Appearances, now or henceforth, indicate what you are,

												    You necessary film, continue to envelop the soul,

												    About my body for me, and your body for you, be hung our divinest aromas,

												    Thrive, cities--bring your freight, bring your shows, ample and

												    sufficient rivers,

												    Expand, being than which none else is perhaps more spiritual,

												    Keep your places, objects than which none else is more lasting.
												  æ
												  You have waited, you always wait, you dumb, beautiful ministers,

												    We receive you with free sense at last, and are insatiate henceforward,

												    Not you any more shall be able to foil us, or withhold yourselves from us,

												    We use you, and do not cast you aside--we plant you permanently within us,

												    We fathom you not--we love you--there is perfection in you also,

												    You furnish your parts toward eternity,

											    Great or small, you furnish your parts toward the soul.



Narrative Poems

#######################################################

I.  The Bank
											    
												  äóìIt goes in ninety seconds!äó I heard a voice

												    Half shout, half whisper, turning my head to see

												    Who called; but all the people standing close
											    æ
												  Were caught, like me, inside the machinery

												    Of the city bank, an ordinary crowd

												    Of clerks and customers lining up for money
											    æ
												  From automated tellers. Crisp bills flowed,

												    Cash to prepare for New Yearäó»s holidays,

												    And no one spoke. The hands on a wall clock glowed
											    æ
												  A minute to five.  A manäó»s eyes met my gaze

												    From down a corridor, one lupine glance

												    Before he disappeared inside the maze.
											    æ
												  Chill from an open window seemed to pounce

												    On me.  The clock showed thirty seconds left

												    Until....   Unsure, I had to take a chance.
											    æ
												  My wife and daughter, lined up somewheres past

												    My view, right then were lost, too far away

												    To reach in time.  Already I felt bereft.
											    æ
												  I seized my son by the hand and cried, äóìNeil, stay

												    With me!äó  Turning, I fought my way out through

												    The throngs and reached a stairwell.  Fearing delay,
											    æ
											    I ran downstairs and out to the avenue.
												  
												     II.  The Street
											    
												  My boy ran too, thinking it all a game.

												    He laughed as we reached the sidewalk, paused and turned.

											      Across the street, the bank tower looked the same
											    æ
												  As when weäó»d enteredäóîno one seemed concerned.

												    I felt quite foolish at my overreaction.

												    But through the next few moments my stomach churned.
											    æ
												  Time seemed to stop dead cold, the real turned fiction.

												    Vague blue smoke oozed through the high bank windows;

												    Electric lights went dead, section by section,
											    æ
												  Leaving gray twilight. And then my heart froze.

												    I stared along the darkened city canyonäóî

												    Buildings, shoulder to shoulder, leaned to enclose
											    æ
												  The empty corridor; and from each one

												    Blue wisps drifted, and each had fallen dark,

												    As had the streetlights, and the forgotten sun.
											    æ
												  I heard no explosion, saw no firework

												    Display, but simply sensed the sudden silence.

												    The boulevard might well have been a park:
											    æ
												  Traffic had stoppedäóîno, disappeared, the dense

												    Urban clutter gone, leaving the people

												    Mouthing their puzzled murmurs of suspense.
											    æ
												  Neil held my hand, and cried, äóìOh, what wonderful

												    Thing has happened?äó I answered, äóìIäó»m not sure,äó

												    Then realized I had to somehow grapple
												  æ
												  With our situation. We crossed to the further

												    Side of the street, and found a row of public

											      Telephones all in use.  I asked one caller
											    æ
												  There if anyone might have sent a quick

												    Word to police, who surely would soon arrive

												    To take control.  The man replied with a flick
											    æ
												  Of finger to lips, as though he meant to give

												    Some sort of warning.  Over at the bank

												    The scene resembled pictures Iäó»d seen live
											    æ
												  On television, news to make me thank

												    God I lived in America, not some foreign

												    Land far across the sea.  Along the flank
											    æ
												  Of the tower, through windows, I saw within

												    Dim figures dressed in black scanning the street.

												    Each appeared to hold an assault weapon,
											    æ
												  And some had electronic gear complete

												    With headsets.  Though blue haze obscured their faces

												    I felt their stares.  I heard the man repeat
											    æ
												  His warning, whispering, äóìThey have devices

												    To listen in on phone calls.äó  Taken aback,

												    My wife and daughter caught up in the crisis,
											    æ
												  Iäó»d hoped police knew of this brazen attack.

												    Remembering I had my own cellular phone

												    With me, I dialed emergency to check
											    æ
												  When help would come. But though at first a tone

												    Sounded, the line was busy, then went dead.

												    I wondered if these strange events were known
											    æ
												  To police, the mayor, the President, who need

												    To serve and protect the honest citizenry.

												    I beckoned Neil, and turning the way that led
											    æ
												  Out of the city, began to walkäóînot flee,

												    More like a Sunday stroll, but hoping to find

												    Some shelter against the growing adversity.
											    æ
												  The night turned colder; I felt a gnawing wind

												    Sting my face as we walked.  Later I carried

												    Neil on my shoulders, humming a tune designed
											    æ
												  To lull him sound asleep.  Some others hurried

												    Along the street as well, but fewer in number

												    As time passed; all grew more anxious and harried.
											    æ
												  Then the street narrowed; our eyes began to blur,

												    Lost in an unfamiliar neighborhood

												    Where boarded windows and strewn garbage deter
											    æ
												  Outsiders from passing through. I understood

												    The risks, yet hoped to find a place to rest.

												    Just then a bearded man emerged from a crude
											    æ
												  Cardboard tent on the sidewalk, dirty and dressed

												    In rags.  He shouted, raised an arm and waved.

												    I hesitated; but then I thought it best
											    æ
												  To march on by, for though my body craved

												    Its sleep I also knew I had to guard

												    My son.  A hazard missed beats a hazard bravedäóî
											    æ
									            I held to the prudent way; but the way was hard.
											    
											       III.  The Halfway House
										        
											    My instincts served me well.  In normal times

											      The city offers refuge and soft comforts;

										        It shelters us from drought and rain, and brims
											    æ
												  With earthäó»s rich bounty.  Humankind diverts

												    Rivers, fields and forests to build the city,

												    Drying flood plains, watering harsh deserts,
											    æ
												  And somehow holds in check its greatest enemyäóî

												    Fearäóîfear of the stranger by every other.

												    When things first fall apart the great calamity
											    æ
												  Starts with dissolution of social order,

												    And then the city turns from home to cage,

												    A piercing look a mere knife thrust from murder.
											    æ
												  Lines of hungry mouths become a rampage

												    Through the shopsäóîthe city devours itself.

												    When fear and want conspire to unleash rage,
											    æ
												  Break free at once before the floods engulf

												    You and those you love!  Escape while you can,

												    And hide yourself from the tooth of the uncaged wolf.
											    æ
												  We fled the city before mobs overran

												    It and blocked the roads, and came to a house

												    Out in the country.  Slipping inside to scan
											    æ
												  The rooms, I found the house brand new and close

												    To finished. Furnished and stocked with food,

												    There was no sign of owners. It seemed their loss
											    æ
												  In these changed times would be our gain, by rude

												    Law of possession.  Oddly, the house lacked doorsäóî

												    Doors, that final touch, still left to conclude
											    æ
												  Construction and bar unwelcome visitors.

												    The great miracle was that my wife and girl

												    Were waiting there, as if unconscious force
											    æ
												  Had drawn us all together despite the swirl

												    Of bitter decay and loss.  I kissed Patricia,

												    And she hugged Neil, as I gave a joyful whirl
											    æ
												  To baby Vanessa.  But through the window I saw

												    A sight that cut our jubilation short:

												    A well-armed gang, some newly-formed militia,
											    æ
												  Was camped outside. The members, wearing a sort

												    Of uniform, all black, were swarming around

												    The street and yard.  We could not hope to thwart
											    æ
												  So many attacking us, as they seemed bound

												    To do.  I slowly drew the blinds to hide

												    As best we could, hoping not to be found
											    æ
												  Just yet, and told the rest to stay inside.

												    Searching the kitchen drawers I found a knife

												    And tucked it in my belt to maybe provide
											    æ
												  Protection.  Through the doorway, after a brief

												    Respite, some men came in.  Their heads were shaved.

												    Although they came unarmed, I told my wife
											    æ
												  To wait in another room.  I was relieved

												    To hear the eldest say the four were brothers,

												    Wandering homeless, caught by the gang and enslaved.
											    æ
												  Before, they all had lived in their father and motheräó»s

												    House, but it had burned in the first outbreak

												    Of violence.  They wanted to join with others.
											    æ
												  Were we to take them in, it could well make

												    The gang attack us all.  äóìWeäó»re only a small

												    Young family,äó I said, äóìso donäó»t mistake
											    æ
												  Our open door for help.äó  Just then a tall

												    Man dressed in black strode through the open doorway;

												    Somehow familiar, his red beret showed all
											    æ
												  He was the leader everyone had to obey.

												    I took due note of the gun he kept in his holster,

												    Thankful he left it there.  His hair was gray,
											    æ
												  His name was Virgil; his manner conveyed some culture.

												    äóìA cup of tea, perhaps?äó I dared to askäóî

												    Virgiläó»s restraint somehow seemed to bolster
											    æ
												  My flagging courage.  Laughing, he raised a flask

												    Of brandy.  My wife brought glasses.  In the kitchen

												    The three of us shared a drink.  It was fine to bask
											    æ
												  In lively conversation, indulging my yen

												    To talk about the times in a thoughtful manner.

												    With just a jerk of his thumb he sent the four men
											    æ
												  Slinking out the dooräóînone dared to demur;

												    And then he told me I must join with him,

												    Bring my family and be his follower.
											    æ
												  I said, äóìMy wife and I need a little time

												    To think it over.äó  At that, though Virgil replied

												    With a nod, his eyes narrowed and smile turned grim.
											    æ
												  äóìYou have till morning, but then you must decide

												    To follow or leaveäóîthis house is my headquarters.äó

												    He went his way; Patricia came to my side.
											    æ
												  äóìDo we stay,äó I asked, äóìand take this strongmanäó»s orders,

												    Or go?äó She paused, then said, äóìYou make the choice.äó

												    I thought awhile, for such a decision alters
											    æ
												  The future in many different ways, sets loose

												    Consequences that cannot be undone.

												    äóìWe leave at dawn,äó I said in a steady voice.
											    æ
											    We sat by the window and watched the setting sun.
												  
												    												    IV.  The Refugee Camp
											    
												  Thereäó»s much I donäó»t remember.  January

												    Was mildäóîit snowed a time or two, I think,

										        But no real blizzards. Nights were often starry;
											    æ
												  Iäó»d wander from the campfires, stare and blink

												    At galaxies across the dark vastness

												    Of time and space. The night sky seemed to shrink
											    æ
												  The changes we endured.  I must confess

												    I clung to hope the changes would be reversed,

												    The army would come, clean up the sordid mess.
											    æ
												  But no one came.  We had to slake our thirst

												    For knowledge with loose rumors: maybe a coup

												    Had toppled the government, or at the worst,
											    æ
												  Civilization had ended.  No one knew

												    Anything solid; all the computers were down

												    And televisions stayed blank.  No story rang true.
											    æ
												  But after a shipwreck, when ocean waves maroon

												    You on an island, it hardly matters which rock

												    The ship had struck, so long as you did not drown.
											    æ
												  Nations feel no pain, nor armies the stroke

												    Of the sword: each man and woman alone must bear

												    What comes in life.  Though those we love may walk
											    æ
												  With us some part of the way, at last we stare

												    At our own fate.  And mine was to go to hell.

												    Some argue if hell is fire or ice.  I swear
											    æ
												  That hell is mud.  We called it Mud Motel,

												    The camp where freezing rain had left us stuck

												    Beside the road, where thick black ooze would swell
											    æ
												  As more refugees came.  We slept in the muck.

												    The name was a jokeäóîthough mud there was, alright,

												    äóìMoteläó meant plastic tarps for those with luck
											    æ
												  And bags for those without.  People would fight

												    To escape if a passing truck was spotted.

												    Food was scarce; disease increased the plight
											    æ
												  As winter dragged. The thing I especially hated

												    Was mud gracefully merging with shallow latrines,

												    The stench soaking your boots and clothes as you squatted.
											    æ
												  Yet through the winter Patricia found some means

												    To keep us decent, washing clothes in the river

												    Upstream, using a strong solvent that cleans
											    æ
												  Well enough, but burns the skin.  And she would never

												    Let go of her long black hair, always washed

												    And combed each day.  I knew how it must grieve her
											    æ
												  To see the changes worsen.  She never lashed

												    Out at me or the children.  Money meant nothingäóî

												    Just barter or steal.  I saw a manäó»s head smashed
											    æ
												  With a rock, blood and brains splattering

												    Black mud, turning it a purple color.

												    I pulled my knife; the killer took a swing
											    æ
												  At me as well.  That ended my bit of valor

												    But also the killeräó»s rage; the man spat

												    In the mud and then backed off.  I heard him holler,
											    æ
												  äóìHe wonäó»t eat my potatoes againäóîthatäó»s that!äó

												    Was I to judge which man was really wronged?

												    The law was a rock, a knife, a baseball batäóî
											    æ
												  A gun.  One afternoon, some boys had ganged

												    Up on another.  It looked like a game of tag,

												    Except one hunter fired as others thronged
											    æ
												  Around their prey, who quivering knelt to beg

												    The gunman to stop.  When I dared intervene

												    The gang turned, and came after me like a plague
											    æ
												  Of locusts.  äóìHeäó»s `itäó» now!äó one yelled, and then

												    The pistol was aimed at me.  I ran for my life,

												    Through some woods and down a small ravine,
											    æ
												  Dodging bullets as I clambered up a cliff

												    To the camp.  Exhausted, I fell face down in the mud.

												    I heard my children cry, and felt my wife
											    æ
												  Throw her body on mine; those who pursued

												    Me stopped and turned away.  But I lay broken;

												    Tears poured out of my heart in a bitter flood.
											    æ
												  Then someone laughed; I felt my shoulder shaken

												    By some strong hand.  äóìGet up! You two are blocking

												    My fleet!äó I knew that voice, and was not mistaken:
											    æ
												  Virgil rode in a jeep; his trucks were flocking

												    Behind him.  äóìThen I told you, `Follow or leave;äó»

												    Now follow or stay.äó  His eyes stared down, mockingäóî
											    æ
												  The eyes of a wolf that had no need to deceive

												    His prey.  I hesitated. äóìPatricia,äó I said,

												    äóìThis time you choose.äó  My wife was not naive,
											    æ
												  Nor Iäóîlike a deer, I froze between dread and dread.

												    His boots were clean, and his crisp black uniform.

												    And then I recalled that man first glimpsed as I fled
											    æ
												  The bank with Neil, my wife left behind in the storm;

												    How she and Vanessa had made their way somehow

												    To Virgiläó»s house.  Her eyes met hisäóîa swarm
											    æ
												  Of demons devoured my guts.  äóìGet in now!äó

												    He ordered.  The children and I got in the back

												    Of the jeep while Virgil opened a door to allow
											    æ
								                Patricia to take the seat beside him.  The brake

												    Was released, the engine surged.  äóìI am your guide,äó

												    Said Virgil; äóìThis is the road you need to take.äó
								                æ
											    I watched the twilight glowing red, and cried.



Love

#######################################################

Down by the salley gardens
   my love and I did meet;
She passed the salley gardens
   with little snow-white feet.
She bid me take love easy,
   as the leaves grow on the tree;
But I, being young and foolish,
   with her would not agree.

In a field by the river
   my love and I did stand,
And on my leaning shoulder
   she laid her snow-white hand.
She bid me take life easy,
   as the grass grows on the weirs;
But I was young and foolish,
   and now am full of tears.
 



Love

#######################################################

In summers heat and mid-time of the day
To rest my limbs upon a bed I lay,
One window shut, the other open stood,
Which gave such light as twinkles in a wood,
Like twilight glimpse at setting of the sun
Or night being past, and yet not day begun.
Such light to shamefaced maidens must be shown,
Where they may sport, and seem to be unknown.
Then came Corinna in a long loose gown,
Her white neck hid with tresses hanging down:
Resembling fair Semiramis going to bed
Or Lais of a thousand wooers sped.
I snatched her gown, being thin, the harm was small,
Yet strived she to be covered therewithal.
And striving thus as one that would be cast,
Betrayed herself, and yielded at the last.
Stark naked as she stood before mine eye,
Not one wen in her body could I spy.

What arms and shoulders did I touch and see,
How apt her breasts were to be pressed by me?
How smooth a belly under her waist saw I?
How large a leg, and what a lusty thigh?
To leave the rest, all liked me passing well,
I clinged her naked body, down she fell,
Judge you the rest: being tired she bad me kiss,
Jove send me more such afternoons as this.

I waited for the train at Coventry;

											      I hung with grooms and porters on the bridge,

											      To match the three tall spires; and there I shaped

											      The city's ancient legend into this:
												  

												    Not only we, the latest seed of Time,

												    New men, that in the flying of a wheel

												    Cry down the past, not only we, that prate

												    Of rights and wrongs, have loved the people well,

												    And loathed to see them overtax'd; but she

												    Did more, and underwent, and overcame,

												    The woman of a thousand summers back,

												    Godiva, wife to that grim Earl, who ruled

												    In Coventry: for when he laid a tax

												    Upon his town, and all the mothers brought

												    Their children, clamouring, "If we pay, we starve!"

												    She sought her lord, and found him, where he strode

												    About the hall, among his dogs, alone,

												    His beard a foot before him, and his hair

												    A yard behind. She told him of their tears,

												    And pray'd him, "If they pay this tax, they starve".

												    Whereat he stared, replying, half-amazed,

"You would not let your little finger ache

For such as these?"--"But I would die," said she.

												    He laugh'd, and swore by Peter and by Paul;

												    Then fillip'd at the diamond in her ear;

"O ay, ay, ay, you talk!"--"Alas!" she said,

"But prove me what it is I would not do."

												    And from a heart as rough as Esau's hand,

												    He answer'd, "Ride you naked thro' the town,

												    And I repeal it"; and nodding as in scorn,

												    He parted, with great strides among his dogs.

												    So left alone, the passions of her mind,

												    As winds from all the compass shift and blow,

												    Made war upon each other for an hour,

												    Till pity won. She sent a herald forth,

												    And bad him cry, with sound of trumpet, all

												    The hard condition; but that she would loose

												    The people: therefore, as they loved her well,

												    From then till noon no foot should pace the street,

												    No eye look down, she passing; but that all

												    Should keep within, door shut, and window barr'd.

												    Then fled she to her inmost bower, and there

												    Unclasp'd the wedded eagles of her belt,

												    The grim Earl's gift; but ever at a breath

												    She linger'd, looking like a summer moon

												    Half-dipt in cloud: anon she shook her head,

												    And shower'd the rippled ringlets to her knee;

												    Unclad herself in haste; adown the stair

												    Stole on; and, like a creeping sunbeam, slid

												    From pillar unto pillar, until she reach'd

												    The gateway; there she found her palfrey trapt

												    In purple blazon'd with armorial gold.

												    Then she rode forth, clothed on with chastity:

												    The deep air listen'd round her as she rode,

												    And all the low wind hardly breathed for fear.

												    The little wide-mouth'd heads upon the spout

												    Had cunning eyes to see: the barking cur

												    Made her cheek flame: her palfrey's footfall shot

												    Light horrors thro' her pulses: the blind walls

												    Were full of chinks and holes; and overhead

												    Fantastic gables, crowding, stared: but she

												    Not less thro' all bore up, till, last, she saw

												    The white-flower'd elder-thicket from the field

												    Gleam thro' the Gothic archways in the wall.

												    Then she rode back cloth'd on with chastity:

												    And one low churl, compact of thankless earth,

												    The fatal byword of all years to come,

												    Boring a little auger-hole in fear,

												    Peep'd--but his eyes, before they had their will,

												    Were shrivell'd into darkness in his head,

												    And dropt before him. So the Powers, who wait

												    On noble deeds, cancell'd a sense misused;

												    And she, that knew not, pass'd: and all at once,

												    With twelve great shocks of sound, the shameless noon

												    Was clash'd and hammer'd from a hundred towers,

												    One after one: but even then she gain'd

												    Her bower; whence reissuing, robed and crown'd,

												    To meet her lord, she took the tax away,

											      And built herself an everlasting name.

The summer and autumn had been so wet,

												    That in winter the corn was growing yet,

												    'Twas a piteous sight to see all around

											      The grain lie rotting on the ground.
												  æ
												  Every day the starving poor

												    Crowded around Bishop Hatto's door,

												    For he had a plentiful last-year's store,

												    And all the neighbourhood could tell

												    His granaries were furnish'd well.
												  æ
												  At last Bishop Hatto appointed a day

												    To quiet the poor without delay;

												    He bade them to his great Barn repair,

												    And they should have food for the winter there.
												  æ
												  Rejoiced such tidings good to hear,

												    The poor folk flock'd from far and near;

												    The great barn was full as it could hold

												    Of women and children, and young and old.
												  æ
												  Then when he saw it could hold no more,

												    Bishop Hatto he made fast the door;

												    And while for mercy on Christ they call,

												    He set fire to the Barn and burnt them all.
												  æ
												  "I'faith 'tis an excellent bonfire!" quoth he,

												    "And the country is greatly obliged to me,

												    For ridding it in these times forlorn

												    Of Rats that only consume the corn."
												  æ
												  So then to his palace returned he,

												    And he sat down to supper merrily,

												    And he slept that night like an innocent man;

												    But Bishop Hatto never slept again.
												  æ
												  In the morning as he enter'd the hall

												    Where his picture hung against the wall,

												    A sweat like death all over him came,

												    For the Rats had eaten it out of the frame.
												  æ
												  As he look'd there came a man from his farm--

												    He had a countenance white with alarm;

												    "My Lord, I open'd your granaries this morn,

												    And the Rats had eaten all your corn."
												  æ
												  Another came running presently,

												    And he was pale as pale could be,

												    "Fly! my Lord Bishop, fly," quoth he,

												    "Ten thousand Rats are coming this way,...

												    The Lord forgive you for yesterday!"
												  æ
												  "I'll go to my tower on the Rhine," replied he,

												    "'Tis the safest place in Germany;

												    The walls are high and the shores are steep,

												    And the stream is strong and the water deep."
												  æ
												  Bishop Hatto fearfully hasten'd away,

												    And he crost the Rhine without delay,

												    And reach'd his tower, and barr'd with care

												    All the windows, doors, and loop-holes there.
												  æ
												  He laid him down and closed his eyes;...

												    But soon a scream made him arise,

												    He started and saw two eyes of flame

												    On his pillow from whence the screaming came.
												  æ
												  He listen'd and look'd;... it was only the Cat;

												    And the Bishop he grew more fearful for that,

												    For she sat screaming, mad with fear

												    At the Army of Rats that were drawing near.
												  æ
												  For they have swum over the river so deep,

												    And they have climb'd the shores so steep,

												    And up the Tower their way is bent,

												    To do the work for which they were sent.
												  æ
												  They are not to be told by the dozen or score,

												    By thousands they come, and by myriads and more,

												    Such numbers had never been heard of before,

												    Such a judgment had never been witness'd of yore.
												  æ
												  Down on his knees the Bishop fell,

												    And faster and faster his beads did he tell,

												    As louder and louder drawing near

												    The gnawing of their teeth he could hear.
												  æ
												  And in at the windows and in at the door,

												    And through the walls helter-skelter they pour,

												    And down from the ceiling and up through the floor,

												    From the right and the left, from behind and before,

												    From within and without, from above and below,

												    And all at once to the Bishop they go.
												  æ
												  They have whetted their teeth against the stones,

												    And now they pick the Bishop's bones:

												    They gnaw'd the flesh from every limb,

											    For they were sent to do judgment on him!

Oh! what's the matter? what's the matter?

												    What is't that ails young Harry Gill?

												    That evermore his teeth they chatter,

												    Chatter, chatter, chatter still!

												    Of waistcoats Harry has no lack,

												    Good duffle grey, and flannel fine;

												    He has a blanket on his back,

											      And coats enough to smother nine.
												  æ
												  In March, December, and in July,

												    'Tis all the same with Harry Gill;

												    The neighbours tell, and tell you truly,

												    His teeth they chatter, chatter still.

												    At night, at morning, and at noon,

												    'Tis all the same with Harry Gill;

												    Beneath the sun, beneath the moon,

												    His teeth they chatter, chatter still!
												  æ
												  Young Harry was a lusty drover,

												    And who so stout of limb as he?

												    His cheeks were red as ruddy clover;

												    His voice was like the voice of three.

												    Old Goody Blake was old and poor;

												    Ill fed she was, and thinly clad;

												    And any man who passed her door

												    Might see how poor a hut she had.
												  æ
												  All day she spun in her poor dwelling:

												    And then her three hours' work at night,

												    Alas! 'twas hardly worth the telling,

												    It would not pay for candle-light.

												    Remote from sheltered village-green,

												    On a hill's northern side she dwelt,

												    Where from sea-blasts the hawthorns lean,

												    And hoary dews are slow to melt.
												  æ
												  By the same fire to boil their pottage,

												    Two poor old Dames, as I have known,

												    Will often live in one small cottage;

												    But she, poor Woman! housed alone.

												    'Twas well enough when summer came,

												    The long, warm, lightsome summer-day,

												    Then at her door the canty Dame

												    Would sit, as any linnet, gay.
												  æ
												  But when the ice our streams did fetter,

												    Oh then how her old bones would shake;

												    You would have said, if you had met her,

												    'Twas a hard time for Goody Blake.

												    Her evenings then were dull and dead:

												    Sad case it was, as you may think,

												    For very cold to go to bed;

												    And then for cold not sleep a wink.
												  æ
												  O joy for her! whene'er in winter

												    The winds at night had made a rout;

												    And scattered many a lusty splinter

												    And many a rotten bough about.

												    Yet never had she, well or sick,

												    As every man who knew her says,

												    A pile beforehand, turf or stick,

												    Enough to warm her for three days.
												  æ
												  Now, when the frost was past enduring,

												    And made her poor old bones to ache,

												    Could anything be more alluring

												    Than an old hedge to Goody Blake?

												    And, now and then, it must be said,

												    When her old bones were cold and chill,

												    She left her fire, or left her bed,

												    To seek the hedge of Harry Gill.
												  æ
												  Now Harry he had long suspected

												    This trespass of old Goody Blake;

												    And vowed that she should be detectedäóî

												    That he on her would vengeance take.

												    And oft from his warm fire he'd go,

												    And to the fields his road would take;

												    And there, at night, in frost and snow,

												    He watched to seize old Goody Blake.
												  æ
												  And once, behind a rick of barley,

												    Thus looking out did Harry stand:

												    The moon was full and shining clearly,

												    And crisp with frost the stubble land.

												    äóîHe hears a noiseäóîhe's all awakeäóî

												    Again?äóîon tip-toe down the hill

												    He softly creepsäóî'tis Goody Blake;

												    She's at the hedge of Harry Gill!
												  æ
												  Right glad was he when he beheld her:

												    Stick after stick did Goody pull:

												    He stood behind a bush of elder,

												    Till she had filled her apron full.

												    When with her load she turned about,

												    The by-way back again to take;

												    He started forward, with a shout,

												    And sprang upon poor Goody Blake.
												  æ
												  And fiercely by the arm he took her,

												    And by the arm he held her fast,

												    And fiercely by the arm he shook her,

												    And cried, "I've caught you then at last!"

												    Then Goody, who had nothing said,

												    Her bundle from her lap let fall;

												    And, kneeling on the sticks, she prayed

												    To God that is the judge of all.
												  æ
												  She prayed, her withered hand uprearing,

												    While Harry held her by the armäóî

												    "God! who art never out of hearing,

												    O may he never more be warm!"

												    The cold, cold moon above her head,

												    Thus on her knees did Goody pray;

												    Young Harry heard what she had said:

											    And icy cold he turned away.
												  

											          
												  He went complaining all the morrow

												    That he was cold and very chill:

												    His face was gloom, his heart was sorrow,

												    Alas! that day for Harry Gill!

												    That day he wore a riding-coat,

												    But not a whit the warmer he:

												    Another was on Thursday brought,

												    And ere the Sabbath he had three.
												  æ
												  'Twas all in vain, a useless matter,

												    And blankets were about him pinned;

												    Yet still his jaws and teeth they clatter,

												    Like a loose casement in the wind.

												    And Harry's flesh it fell away;

												    And all who see him say, 'tis plain

												    That, live as long as live he may,

												    He never will be warm again.
												  æ
												  No word to any man he utters,

												    A-bed or up, to young or old;

												    But ever to himself he mutters,

												    "Poor Harry Gill is very cold."

												    A-bed or up, by night or day;

												    His teeth they chatter, chatter still.

												    Now think, ye farmers all, I pray,

											    Of Goody Blake and Harry Gill!

Gramma's gone, but not forgotten,

												    that's her apron hanging there.

												    It still hangs in Grampa's kitchen.

											      Sometimes he looks at it and stares.
												  æ
												  When Gramma wore her apron

												    it was magical to see.

												    The pockets held such treasures

												    for the grandkids just like me.
												  æ
												  Saw it shine up Grampa's fender once

												    just as pretty as you please,

												    and it wiped my brother's cheek off

												    one time when he sneezed.
												  æ
												  It took cookies from the oven,

												    it rushed to wipe a tear,

												    got a grain of sand out of your eye,

												    made a lap for the stories we'd hear.
												  æ
												  It wiped spills up from the countertop

												    when she was baking pies,

												    a symbol of her love and care

												    and it showed, too, in her eyes.
												  æ
												  Sometimes I'm sad to look at it

												    when I see my Grampa stare.

												    Gramma's gone, but not forgotten.

												    That's her apron hanging there.



Flower Poems

#######################################################

Why do the lilies goggle their tongues at me

												    When I pluck them;

												    And writhe, and twist,

												    And strangle themselves against my fingers,

												    So that I can hardly weave the garland

												    For your hair?

												    Why do they shriek your name

												    And spit at me

												    When I would cluster them?

												    Must I kill them

												    To make them lie still,

												    And send you a wreath of lolling corpses

												    To turn putrid and soft

												    On your forehead

											      While you dance?



Mythological

#######################################################

I leaned against the mantel, sick, sick,
Thinking of my failure, looking into the abysm,
Weak from the noon-day heat.
A church bell sounded mournfully far away,
I heard the cry of a baby,
And the coughing of John Yarnell,
Bed-ridden, feverish, feverish, dying,
Then the violent voice of my wife:
"Watch out, the potatoes are burning!"
I smelled them ... then there was irresistible disgust.
I pulled the trigger ... blackness ... light ...
Unspeakable regret ... fumbling for the world again.
Too late! Thus I came here,
With lungs for breathing ... one cannot breathe here with lungs,
Though one must breathe
Of what use is it To rid one's self of the world,
When no soul may ever escape the eternal destiny of life?



Women Poems

Across the kitchen table a

												    bizarre mouth 

												    opens and closes like an elevator, and her voice drones

											      as if there is a fly trapped inside.
												  æ
												  In a perverse happy tone, 

												    she tells tales about the troubles of friends of a friend,

												    scuttling out from her tongue like cockroaches

												    each bug screaming Schadenfreude, Schadenfreude.
												  æ
												  It is as if I am reading her face as the Rosetta Stone äóñ

												    three scripts of the same text

												    ancient greek, demotic script, hieroglyphics.

												    Except this face is harder to decipher,

												    it is all greek to me and reveals

												    nothing of the blonde Nefertiti in front of me.
												  æ
								                I want to ask her if what she really wants is

												    to peel then crush her shell of a home 

												    like a garlic clove,

												    grate off her high heels

												    with a pumice stone

												    then run flat-footed

												    like an infant or the wife of an ape?
								                æ
											    I picture her after I leave, still sat at the table 

												    like a salt-cellar

												    exposing a white skull of crystals,

												    clothing her black torso of peppercorns looking 

												    like millions of small dead hearts

												    thrown into one body-pot

												    never ground hard enough to disappear.



Narrative Poems

#######################################################

'T WAS on the famous trotting-ground,

												    The betting men were gathered round

												    From far and near; the "cracks" were there

												    Whose deeds the sporting prints declare

												    The swift g. m., Old Hiram's nag,

												    The fleet s. h., Dan Pfeiffer's brag,

												    With these a third--and who is he

												    That stands beside his fast b. g.?

												    Budd Doble, whose catarrhal name

												    So fills the nasal trump of fame.

												    There too stood many a noted steed

												    Of Messenger and Morgan breed;

												    Green horses also, not a few;

												    Unknown as yet what they could do;

												    And all the hacks that know so well

											      The scourgings of the Sunday swell.
												  æ
												  Blue are the skies of opening day;

												    The bordering turf is green with May;

												    The sunshine's golden gleam is thrown

												    On sorrel, chestnut, bay, and roan;

												    The horses paw and prance and neigh,

												    Fillies and colts like kittens play,

												    And dance and toss their rippled manes

												    Shining and soft as silken skeins;

												    Wagons and gigs are ranged about,

												    And fashion flaunts her gay turn-out;

												    Here stands--each youthful Jehu's dream

												    The jointed tandem, ticklish team!

												    And there in ampler breadth expand

												    The splendors of the four-in-hand;

												    On faultless ties and glossy tiles

												    The lovely bonnets beam their smiles;

												    (The style's the man, so books avow;

												    The style's the woman, anyhow);

												    From flounces frothed with creamy lace

												    Peeps out the pug-dog's smutty face,

												    Or spaniel rolls his liquid eye,

												    Or stares the wiry pet of Skye,--

												    O woman, in your hours of ease

												    So shy with us, so free with these!
												  æ
												  "Come on! I 'll bet you two to one

												    I 'll make him do it!" "Will you? Done!"
												  æ
												  What was it who was bound to do?

												    I did not hear and can't tell you,--

												    Pray listen till my story's through.
												  æ
												  Scarce noticed, back behind the rest,

												    By cart and wagon rudely prest,

												    The parson's lean and bony bay

												    Stood harnessed in his one-horse shay--

												    Lent to his sexton for the day;

												    (A funeral--so the sexton said;

												    His mother's uncle's wife was dead.)
												  æ
												  Like Lazarus bid to Dives' feast,

												    So looked the poor forlorn old beast;

												    His coat was rough, his tail was bare,

												    The gray was sprinkled in his hair;

												    Sportsmen and jockeys knew him not,

												    And yet they say he once could trot

												    Among the fleetest of the town,

												    Till something cracked and broke him down,--

												    The steed's, the statesman's, common lot!

												    "And are we then so soon forgot?"

												    Ah me! I doubt if one of you

												    Has ever heard the name "Old Blue,"

												    Whose fame through all this region rung

												    In those old days when I was young!
												  æ
												  "Bring forth the horse!" Alas! he showed

												    Not like the one Mazeppa rode;

												    Scant-maned, sharp-backed, and shaky-kneed,

												    The wreck of what was once a steed,

												    Lips thin, eyes hollow, stiff in joints;

												    Yet not without his knowing points.

												    The sexton laughing in his sleeve,

												    As if 't were all a make-believe,

												    Led forth the horse, and as he laughed

												    Unhitched the breeching from a shaft,

												    Unclasped the rusty belt beneath,

												    Drew forth the snaffle from his teeth,

												    Slipped off his head-stall, set him free

												    From strap and rein,--a sight to see!
												  æ
												  So worn, so lean in every limb,

												    It can't be they are saddling him!

												    It is! his back the pig-skin strides

												    And flaps his lank, rheumatic sides;

												    With look of mingled scorn and mirth

												    They buckle round the saddle-girth;

												    With horsey wink and saucy toss

												    A youngster throws his leg across,

												    And so, his rider on his back,

												    They lead him, limping, to the track,

												    Far up behind the starting-point,

												    To limber out each stiffened joint.
												  æ
												  As through the jeering crowd he past,

												    One pitying look Old Hiram cast;

												    "Go it, ye cripple, while ye can!"

												    Cried out unsentimental Dan;

												    "A Fast-Day dinner for the crows!"

												    Budd Doble's scoffing shout arose.
												  æ
												  Slowly, as when the walking-beam

												    First feels the gathering head of steam,

												    With warning cough and threatening wheeze

												    The stiff old charger crooks his knees;

												    At first with cautious step sedate,

												    As if he dragged a coach of state

												    He's not a colt; he knows full well

												    That time is weight and sure to tell;

												    No horse so sturdy but he fears

												    The handicap of twenty years.
												  æ
												  As through the throng on either hand

												    The old horse nears the judges' stand,

												    Beneath his jockey's feather-weight

												    He warms a little to his gait,

												    And now and then a step is tried

												    That hints of something like a stride.
												  æ
												  "Go!"--Through his ear the summons stung

												    As if a battle-trump had rung;

												    The slumbering instincts long unstirred

												    Start at the old familiar word;

												    It thrills like flame through every limb,--

												    What mean his twenty years to him?

												    The savage blow his rider dealt

												    Fell on his hollow flanks unfelt;

												    The spur that pricked his staring hide

												    Unheeded tore his bleeding side;

												    Alike to him are spur and rein,--

												    He steps a five-year-old again!
												  æ
												  Before the quarter pole was past,

												    Old Hiram said, "He's going fast."

												    Long ere the quarter was a half,

												    The chuckling crowd had ceased to laugh;

												    Tighter his frightened jockey clung

												    As in a mighty stride he swung,

												    The gravel flying in his track,

												    His neck stretched out, his ears laid back,

												    His tail extended all the while

												    Behind him like a rat-tail file!

												    Off went a shoe,--away it spun,

												    Shot like a bullet from a gun;
												  æ
												  The quaking jockey shapes a prayer

												    From scraps of oaths he used to swear;

												    He drops his whip, he drops his rein,

												    He clutches fiercely for a mane;

												    He'll lose his hold--he sways and reels--

												    He'll slide beneath those trampling heels!

												    The knees of many a horseman quake,

												    The flowers on many a bonnet shake,

												    And shouts arise from left and right,

												    "Stick on! Stick on!" "Hould tight! Hould tight!"

												    "Cling round his neck and don't let go--"

												    "That pace can't hold--there! steady! whoa!"

												    But like the sable steed that bore

												    The spectral lover of Lenore,

												    His nostrils snorting foam and fire,

												    No stretch his bony limbs can tire;

												    And now the stand he rushes by,

												    And "Stop him!--stop him!" is the cry.

												    Stand back! he 's only just begun--

												    He's having out three heats in one!
												  æ
												  "Don't rush in front! he'll smash your brains;

												    But follow up and grab the reins!"

												    Old Hiram spoke. Dan Pfeiffer heard,

												    And sprang impatient at the word;

												    Budd Doble started on his bay,

												    Old Hiram followed on his gray,

												    And off they spring, and round they go,

												    The fast ones doing "all they know."

												    Look! twice they follow at his heels,

												    As round the circling course he wheels,

												    And whirls with him that clinging boy

												    Like Hector round the walls of Troy;

												    Still on, and on, the third time round

												    They're tailing off! they're losing ground!

												    Budd Doble's nag begins to fail!

												    Dan Pfeiffer's sorrel whisks his tail!

												    And see! in spite of whip and shout,

												    Old Hiram's mare is giving out!

												    Now for the finish! at the turn,

												    The old horse--all the rest astern--

												    Comes swinging in, with easy trot;

												    By Jove! he's distanced all the lot!
												  æ
												  That trot no mortal could explain;

												    Some said, "Old Dutchman come again!"

												    Some took his time,--at least they tried,

												    But what it was could none decide;

												    One said he couldn't understand

												    What happened to his second hand;

												    One said 2.10; that could n't be--

												    More like two twenty-two or three;

												    Old Hiram settled it at last;

												    "The time was two--too dee-vel-ish fast!"
												  æ
												  The parson's horse had won the bet;

												    It cost him something of a sweat;

												    Back in the one-horse shay he went;

												    The parson wondered what it meant,

												    And murmured, with a mild surprise

												    And pleasant twinkle of the eyes,

												    That funeral must have been a trick,

												    Or corpses drive at double-quick;

												    I should n't wonder, I declare,

												    If brother--Jehu--made the prayer!
												  æ
												  And this is all I have to say

												    About that tough old trotting bay,

												    Huddup! Huddup! G'lang! Good day!

												    Moral for which this tale is told

											    A horse can trot, for all he 's old.

Narrative Poems

#######################################################

A doorway is a hopeless hiding place

												    and the sweet smell of love

												    like aniseed to tracker dogs

												    who growl and snap our feet.

												    Blacked-out tenements crowd

												    this labyrinth of unfamiliar streets,

												    too dark to see the scuffling rats.

												    Night in this town of sounds:

												    our two sets of running feet,

												    the panting of our breath

												    barking dogs and hunters yells

												    echo off buildings, closing for the kill.

												    Shivering listeners cower behind each window

											      and their prayers fail to cloak us.
												  æ
												  We squeeze each other's hands

												    Bill says, "I love you"

												    but capture's searchlight blinds my face

												    and my reply is prisonered.

												    I clamp my chattering teeth and

												    trembling finds new home in my knees.

												    German voices ring behind the light

												    - disembodied shout, "Against the wall!"

												    I lean to stop myself from falling,

												    a loose-stringed puppet.

												    I will not sob. It will not end this way.

												    I cough my voice down low to give

												    false rank and serial number

												    deforming my Czech vowels.
												  æ
												  Marching to the prison camp

												    I keep my eyes fixed far ahead.

												    As men piss against trees

												    steam rising in the chilly air

												    I sew my bladder tight.

												    The camp wall's wire looks flimsy

												    inadequate, until I see the guns.

												    I bite my tongue, hope "Hail Mary"

												    will contain the fear, prevent it

												    bubbling, hot-spring, from my lips.

												    Words swirl within my head

												    trapped blizzard in a snow-globe.
												  æ
												  The British officer, as young as us,

												    conducts a tour which includes the latrines

												    "Not quite the Ritz," says Ralph

												    but I am overjoyed, long hours undam'd,

												    the sweet relief!

												    Ralph says, "At night we leave

												    our trousers and our boots in here."

												    Bill asks, "What do we wear?"

												    "Pyjamas, if you've got them

												    or your birthday suit."

												    I clamp my teeth together.

												    My mouth is clogged with sand.

												    I am the sphinx.

												    Bill now speaks my words,

												    "Sir, Sergeant Smith here...

	                        is my wife."
											    æ
												  Ralph sets a bunkhouse sentry,

												    says the words, "We have a woman

												    in the camp." A cheer vibrates the roof,

												    whistles , "Me first," stamping,

												    "Will she do us all?" Ralph bangs

												    his tin mug, "That's enough of that,

												    she's our new inmate's wife,

												    and under our protection."

												    Bill says: "She helped me to escape

												    - bridge building - in her village.";

												    Pale English prisoner in my man-less world

												    snatched daily glances, whispered plans

												    the lazy guard deaf-drunk on spirit

												    distilled from mother's plums.

												    "We found a priest to marry us

												    and have been walking for ten nights."

												    Ten days of bliss and fear

												    in haystacks, stables, barns,

												    adventure beyond boredest dreams.

												    Rich cream turned sour over night.
												  æ
												  Ralph coughs, äóìWeäó»ll need some small pyjamas.äó

												    A wiry Scot climbs down from the bunk

												    where heäó»s lain prone. Men mutter

												    as he presents striped cotton. äóìTheyäó»re none

												    too clean,äó he says, äóìI was nae expecting

												    visitors.äó He turns, äóìAnd bye-the-bye

												    Iäó»ll kill the man who messes with the lassie;

												    he wouldnae be my first.äó They nod

												    knowing about the Glasgow razor gang.

												    I donäó»t, but hug the smell-soaked, stiff

												    pyjamas, rough cloak of invisibility

										      and my trousseau.
												  æ
												  Dusk roll-call whistle sounds outside the hut,

												    Ralph nods, äóìDiversionäó to the Scot

												    who lines up close behind me, Bill in front.

												    The guard yawns at his routine search

												    wild terror pulses through my veins.

												    Once times six is six. I will not faint.

												    Two times six is twelve. Look him in the eye.

												    Three times six is eighteen. Searching Bill,

												    his hunger-skinny arms and chest.

												    Four times six is twenty-four. German hands

												    pat my legs, hips,äó_ Scotty calls,

												    äóìFat arsed German pansy. Going to lose the war.

												    Like you did before.äó The sentry freezes.

												    Joyful, derisive chorus in the line.

												    äóìGoing to lose the war, like you did before!äó

												    Five times six, heäó»s gone. I could smell his breath

												    beer and cigarettes and garlic sausage.

												    I march now. Out into the air. Deep breaths.

												    Left. Right.
												  æ
												  In the wash room, men are singing

												    äóìRoll me over, in the clover, roll me over

												    lay me down and do it again.äó

												    Their eyes are curious, hungry,

												    tension prickles air -- suppressed desire.

												    Bill stays close, Ralph and Scotty watchful.

												    Men try for modesty, and I avert my eyes.

												    The girl I was ten days ago still shocked

												    by menäó»s close naked bodies, smell of sweat,

												    but terror-of-discoveryäó»s a giant

												    whose shadow shrinks all other fear.
												  æ
												  In dank latrine I pull on stained pyjamas,

												    tighten the binding round my breasts.

												    We file barefoot from the wash room.

												    I see the thin legs of the man in front,

												    pants hang off scrawny naked buttocks.

												    I stare beyond the German guard,

												    pass, with a panic-rush, form fists,

												    and concentrate on nails piercing palms.

												    A tiny stone embeds between my toes.

												    I try to think of that.
												  æ
												  Our daily mealäó»s thin soup and bread,

												    which some devour ravenously

												    but others eke out crumb by crumb

												    watched by wolves.

												    Before lights-out they show an apple tub

												    which serves as night urinal for us all.

												    Bill whispers, äóì I can help you, if need be,äó

												    judging the difficulties of its size and height.

												    Ralph says äóìSheäó»ll take her turn to scrub it out.äó

												    No gallant favours to expose me.

												    The bunk house slowly settles till

												    I tune into Billäó»s breathing, irregular below,

												    the whole bunk rocks and creaks as he turns

												    and I caress the movement

												    my new wifeäó»s body longs for his

												    cold in my scratchy blanket

												    my rash girläó»s heart cries out for home.

												    I hope I wonäó»t have to wee in the night.

												    When I was little and I crouched

												    I always splashed my shoes.

												    Red shoes. Shiny. With small bows.
												  æ
												  At dawn we are route-marched to work.

												    We quarry rock as punishment.

												    Ralph says äóìIäó»ve lost three stones this year,äó

												    weighing himself where they weigh rock.

												    The German guards are young like us

												    except for one who keeps apart, as shunned.

												    We seem a crowd of sickly schoolboys

												    gangly, playing at prisoners, but

												    for the depth of age within our eyes.

												    The quarry is a bowl of noise

												    shouts, trucks, explosions,

												    chipping of pickaxes as great stones

												    are released from cliff by sweat and muscle.

												    Two men donate spare foot-rags

												    to wrap my hands against the shovel.

												    But still the blisters raise, and burst

												    and bleed and I am thirsty and my muscles

												    ache, for all I tell myself Iäó»m young and strong.

												    The day is never ending and Billäó»s face

												    pinched with self-reproach at this, my honeymoon.
												  æ
												  At night I dream of home, and wake wet-faced.

												    The note I left my mother burns my mind

												    propped against the blue milk jug

												    I see my pencilled writing, neat, defiant,

												    the words I failed to speak: elope and love.

												    I dare not see her face, but picture

												    roughened hands and broken nails,

												    careless letter clutched to faded apron

												    my sisters fluttering to comfort,

												    failing to console. I want my Mama,

												    ache to stroke her hair.
												  æ
												  This will be the shape of days and nights:

												    working through exhaustion to a place beyond,

												    twice daily searches, terror like a second skin.

												    Watching Billäó»s excited movements when he talks

												    of pork pies, roly poly, spotted dick

												    longing to kiss his blonde eyelashes, skinny frame.

												    The need for complete silence is the worst.

												    Not just the utter speechlessness, but fear

												    I will emit some small instinctive noise

												    a cough or sneeze pitched way too high

												    to be a manäó»s, and give us all away. And

												    all the while my thoughts run with the conversations

												    I cannot, must not hold, until I fear they will

												    burst from the prison of my lips.

												    I picture my teeth wired together

												    and my tongue lying leaden in my mouth

												    to prevent the words escaping.
												  æ
												  And in the quarry under guardsäó» keen eyes,

												    the men share my load , trusting

												    my silence with all their secret heart.

												    Ralph was at Oxford, studying classics

												    and he longs for his books and friends

												    äóìTo walk all day - imagine that äóñ no-one

												    to say which way, or when to stop.äó

												    He is the one who never mentions girls,

												    except his sisters, mother and her cat.

												    Scottyäó»s accent jars and rips the words, but

												    äóìIäó»m on the run,äó he burrs, äóì I killed

												    my sisteräó»s bastard of a husband.äó

												    He feared jail more than death in war.

												    äóìIäó»ve done my time here, prisoner three years.äó

												    The overcrowded tenement or cell

												    are all that wait for him. Ralph says

												    before I came, Scotty lay face-to-wall

												    summoning death. äóì Imprisonment

												    and empty dreams can do that to a man.äó

												    And dear Bill talks of railway cottages

												    allotments raining feasts of plenty,

												    äóìIäó»ll grow our vegetables,äó he shines, äóìand never

												    let you and our family go hungry.äó

												    Strange friends these three,

												    a gangster, student and a railway clerk.

												    No peace-time trinity.
												  æ
												  Each night my silent thank-you prayers

												    for one more day alive with Bill, but

												    echoes of the quarry are our lullaby

												    ringing in my ears, the sound of sweat.

												    I am re-virgined, chaste as moon

												    trapped in a cube of silence

												    bedded by loneliness, sleeping half a sleep.

												    I wake each morning with Terror

												    sitting on my chest,

												    a hairy beast with teeth and claws

												    and evil breath. It sucks the life from me

												    it whispers äóÖparting,äó» äóÖrapeäó» and äóÖdeath.äó»

												    I see Bill hears its snarling too

												    but grins, äóìChin up!äó and winks.

												    I concentrate to shrink the monster,

												    crushing and folding till it fits

												    within a metal box and turn the key.
												  æ
												  I watch the waxing moon and wonder

												    how I can ask, what I could say,

												    chalk-lipped, dust-tongued.

												    Last time it was a quarter, just before

												    the escape and our wedding, and now

												    a new sliver of moon whispers it is near.

												    What is the English word for blood?

												    Do English men know of such things?

												    I almost cry when shyly Bill hands me

												    a neat pile of cut-up strips of rag,

												    his face, half shamed, half pleased

												    the first gift he has given me,

												    donations from the whole bunk house.

												    I bless the saints that Ralph had sisters.
												  æ
												  Theyäó»ve cut my hair! äóìShort back and sides.äó

												    I hate it, hate it, hate it. Want to hide and weep.

												    Glancing in the broken mirror where they shave

												    my eyes seem huge now, cheek bones angular.

												    It should make me feel safe to look so ugly,

												    but I raise my eyes to Billäó»s and see what?

												    Can womanhood be lost with a few locks of hair?

												    I run my fingers through the bristly spikes

												    my hedgehog-head, and will it to sprout back.
												  æ
												  The need to speak and to be heard

												    grows, like a babyäó»s need for milk.

												    and I could wail at full lung power.

												    I tell myself stories; spin them out,

												    word by precious word till I can smell

												    the gingerbread house and the fetid breath

												    of the wolf. I am bewitched, somnamule speech

												    the sleeping beauty in a spell, Snow white

												    in her glass coffin. Sometimes I try

												    the stories to myself in English,

												    picturing eager children, blonde as Bill.

												    But I donäó»t know the words for stepmother

												    or witch or woodcutter or axe.

												    When I was a girl my mother said

												    I chattered like a magpie

												    even in my sleep, as if I knew one day

												    the words would all be stopped,

												    wine corked up in a bottle.
												  æ
												  I concentrate on listening, to improve my English,

												    I memorise the words as they play cards

												    äóìYou cheat!äó äóìHard luck!äó

												    but itäó»s too fast and I canäó»t say, äóìStop please

												    what means this Mufti, twiddling, or bollocks?äó

												    How will it sound when I take tea with English ladies

												    and speak like soldiers in a barrack room?
												  æ
												  I wonder how my voice will sound

												    when I can speak again. Will it be low and masculine

												    like voices circling round me every day?

												    Or like my motheräó»s harassed tone,

												    äóìYou think I like this drudgery,

												    that I donäó»t want excitement too.äó

												    Or like sweet baritone of fatheräó»s song

												    before he left to join the partisans.

												    For my own voice has flown,

												    A small dun bird lost in the camouflage

												    and this one speaking in my head

												    is full of all the others I have heard,

												    leaked into me, brim-full.
												  æ
												  Each month the Red Cross parcels come

												    for them (and blood for me)

												    and then I feel their pity. No letters

												    from my home, but on my bunk I find

												    small gifts, of cake and itchy socks

												    which I pretend my mother made

												    tokens of her forgiveness.

												    Within my silent chrysalis

												    I long to show her how I grow

												    cramped wings Iäó»ll beat against this crispid shell.
											    æ
												  The older man among the guards

												    the despised Kurt, begins to follow me

												    to touch my bottom as he passes by.

												    Ralph says, äóìYou arenäó»t the first.äó

												    My stoppered words turn waspish

												    trapped beneath an up-turned jar

												    frantic, buzzing for a chance to sting.

												    Kurt watches at lights-out, but weäó»re prepared

												    and in the darkness Scotty takes my place.

												    We listen as the door sighs open and his boots

												    creak to the bunk. Then, crack! a well-aimed fist

												    connects with face, and fingers twist his balls.

												    He staggers from the hut and on parade next day

												    his eye is black, and he avoids my stare

												    I have made a dangerous enemy.

												    But news of allied forces breathing near

												    makes guards more careful, picturing defeat
												  æ
												  We shape our plans and when the last

												    Red Cross parcels come, by strength of will

												    against our salivating instincts

												    we stow some food. One morning

												    when we wake, the guards are gone

												    afraid, like me, of Russians.

												    The gates stand open and we are bemused

												    watchful in case it is a trap.

												    We gather up our blankets and supplies

												    and pass, breath-holding, through the fence

												    and off, north-east, like homing birds

												    towards the green and pleasant land

										      beyond burning Germany.
												  æ
												  We trudge down past the quarry

												    Scotty spits into the silent pit

												    Ralph blesses memory of good men

												    who died. Our vigilance distracted,

												    we fail to see Kurt waiting

												    gun trained on us, eyes glittering revenge.

												    Square fingers trace the memory of

												    his bruise. Kurt cocks his gun.

												    We freeze, no sound but one-anotheräó»s

												    living breath. He advances slowly

												    wants to drink my fear.

												    Left-handedly he fumbles at his flies

												    and indicates to me to drop my trousers.

												    He keeps his gun trained on my chest

												    and tears spring to my eyes.

												    But movement äóñ dark shape rushes äóñ

												    a gunshot and I drop, face into mud

												    not sure if I am hit äóñ scuffles, cursing,

												    I see Kurt fall on Scottyäó»s body,

												    Ralph wrests the gun while Bill

												    kneels on Kurtäó»s back, twisting, cracking arm.

												    Yet when they haul him off, a red

												    grin has been opened in his throat

												    by practised knife, as Scotty took the bullet

												    meant for me.

												    And Ralph, in madness, shoots into

												    the lifeless Germanäó»s face.

												    Bill grabs his arm, äóìStop now äóñ the noise äóñ

												    and we might need those rounds.äó

												    We look away as Ralph, cheeks wet,

												    kisses Scottyäó»s brow and covers up his face.

												    We have no tools to dig, so heap

												    a cairn of stones, for which his fingers bled.

												    Ralphäó»s words are dammed as mine

												    so Bill says the Lordäó»s Prayer. I take

												    Ralphäó»s arm and guide his sightless

												    eyes towards tomorrow.
												  æ
												  Four days we walk, ekeing out careful rations,

												    digging turnips from the fields, hiding from guns

												    of dead-eyed Aryans in retreat.

												    Our breath makes clouds in crisp dark air,

												    Eachäó»s step one nearer longed for / alien life

												    of beds and breakfasts and newspapers.

												    We plod in silent-world where words

												    have lost the will to flow

												    stone-tongued like cooling lava.

												    At night we huddle, babes in wood,

												    Billäó»s arms around me on the frozen ground

												    tight like sorrow-joy around my heart.
												  æ
												  The rumble of more trucks announce

												    troops of a different colour

												    accents like the movies, unreal

												    as warm beds and hot dinners.

												    We approach slowly, with our hands in air.

												    Bill shouts, äóìEnglish, English prisoners,äó

												    and they advance to meet us, overfed and huge.

												    salutes and hearty handshakes and back-slaps.

												    Bill and Ralph give names and ranks

												    and as they turn to me, fresh words ascend

												    like dazzling butterflies circling my head,

												    released at last. I hear my voice,

												    "How do you do, my name is Mrs Anna Brown.
												  
												    Based on a true story



Dream Poems

#######################################################

From a note by Ivo AndriÛ
									            
							                    I dreamed I slept, and in that sleep I dreamed,

												    and from that double dream interior woke

												    and walked in a closed courtyard. Someone spoke

												    behind me, and I turned. A dark girl beamed

												    brown eyes at me. I gazed. 'Just as you seemed

												    in dream to dream, so by the double stroke

												    of waking into waking, from this yoke

												    youäó»ve shouldered, may you be redeemed.'
							                    æ
											    So when I enter my last mortal sleep,

												    after all dreams have gone, and I am dead,

												    will then I wake and, doubly waking, keep

												    some mirror of that garden in my head

												    and, back inside it, rising from the deep

												    distress of death, sleepwalk, or wake instead?



Death Poems

#######################################################

If I shouldn't be alive

												    When the robins come,

												    Give the one in red cravat

											      A memorial crumb.
												  æ
												  If I couldn't thank you,

												    Being just asleep,

												    You will know I'm trying

												    With my granite lip!



War Poems

#######################################################

You know, we French stormed Ratisbon:

												    A mile or so away

												    On a little mound, Napoleon 

												    Stood on our storming-day;

												    With neck out-thrust, you fancy how, 

												    Legs wide, arms locked behind,

												    As if to balance the prone brow 

											      Oppressive with its mind.
												  æ
												  Just as perhaps he mused "My plans

												    That soar, to earth may fall, 

												    Let once my army-leader Lannes

												    Waver at yonder wall"äóî

												    Out 'twixt the battery-smokes there flew

												    A rider, bound on bound

												    Full-galloping; nor bridle drew 

												    Until he reached the mound, 
												  æ
												  Then off there flung in smiling joy, 

												    And held himself erect

												    By just his horse's mane, a boy:

												    hardly could suspectäóî 

												    (So tight he kept his lips compressed. 

												    Scarce any blood came through)

												    You looked twice ere you saw his breast 

												    Was all but shot in two. 
												  æ
												  "Well," cried he, "Emperor, by God's grace 

												    We've got you Ratisbon!

												    The Marshal's in the market-place, 

												    And you'll be there anon

												    To see your flag-bird flap his vans

												    Where I, to heart's desire,

												    Perched him!" The chief's eye flashed; his plans 

												    Soared up again like fire. 
												  æ
												  The chief's eye flashed; but presently

												    Softened itself, as sheathes 

												    A film the mother-eagle's eye

												    When her bruised eaglet breathes.

  "You're wounded!" "Nay," the soldier's pride 

												    Touched to the quick, he said:

  "I'm killed, Sire!" And his chief beside,

											    Smiling, the boy fell dead.



America Poems

#######################################################

Filling in for an absent teacher

												    at a middle school

												    somewhere in the city of Downey,

												    I look out the classroom window

												    before the first bell,

												    before any students arrive on campusäóî

												    the classroom peacefully quietäóî

												    and I see a giant native Indian painted 

												    on a huge wall that faces

												    a small green field and a black top

											      where students are supposed to line up for P.E.
												  æ
												  In a sudden rageäóîmy nostrils flaredäóî

												    I scowl and shake my head.
												  æ
												  What gall, I think, 

												    knowing full well this country

												    was forged from the genocide of American Indians. 
												  æ
												  We butchered theyäó»re culture. 

												    We butchered theyäó»re lifestyles.

												    We butchered theyäó»re families.

												    We butchered theyäó»re livestock.

												    We butchered theyäó»re rituals.

												    We butchered theyäó»re matrimonial beliefs.

												    We slandered theyäó»re forefathers

												    and their spirituality

												    and polluted the waters

												    and the sky

												    and cut down the trees;

												    and just to be nice, to continue the belief

												    that Americans are hospitable people,

												    we let them keep some land

												    in the middle of nowhere

												    and placed boundaries around them

												    and called these ostrisized areas reservations

												    and let them sort out the total annihilation

												    of their identity on their own.
												  æ
												  Wanting to break the window of the classroom

												    and spit on the linoleum floor,

												    I turn and glance around the room,

												    which is filled with history books

												    that glorify the white manäó»s pursuit of progress

												    and how heäó»s explored the new world

												    and how heäó»s conquered the wilderness

												    and how heäó»s risen to the status

												    of President of the Unites States, 

												    and I clench my fists

												    and turn to face the window 

												    again, and I stare at that painted Indian Mascot

												    on the school wall with a look of shocked horror;

												    the Indian, for the white man, 

												    has become a thing of mythology,

												    something not real, something in the text books,

												    something to disgustingly admire like a wild animal

												    that had once roamed the civilized planet. 

												    äóìMother fuckers,äó I say with a sneering smirk, knowing the politicians, 

												    and even the administrators of this school, the ones who actually decided 

												    on using the Indian as a mascot just didnäó»t know any better. 

												    Iäó»m sure they figured they were honoring the Indian 

												    rather than insulting him; and in a blue-berry-pie-kind-of-way, 

												    I feel the warmth of that thought. Thatäó»s the American for you: 

												    weäó»ll kill you if you have what we want,

												    and then weäó»ll revere you and put you on some kind of heroic pedestal 

												    to justify our guilt and to inspire the revolution in us all. But still, 

												    standing in that American classroom, on territory that had once blossomed 

												    with wild grass and wild trees, animals living off the land and a myriad of streams trickling with slithery slabs of sunshineäóîthe sound of birds chirping in towering branchesäóîI canäó»t let go 

												    of this overwhelming injustice strangling me 

												    from within; looking out that window, noticing 

												    the metal fence surrounding the schooläó»s grass field and all the buildings 

												    behind that fence 

												    and the sidewalks and the roads and the streetlights 

												    and the cars zooming past, I picture a Patwin mother crying from the death of her childäóîmourning paint running down the sides of her cheeks. 

												    I hear the avenging wails of Crazy Horse

												    and Sitting Bull. I see teepees burning.

												    I see forests burning.

												    I see green hills transform into factories. 

												    I see the buffalo stripped of skin.

												    I hear the neighing of a skeleton horse.

												    I picture the bones of a Cherokee warrior 

												    on that horse, and I feel the intensity of his eyes; 

												    somehow those dead, immortal eyes possess my eyes; 

												    and I look at that mascot on the wall, and I canäó»t believe 

												    theyäó»re getting away with it, these Americans, flaunting their murderous greed 

												    and morals to generations of children, perhaps

												    not in the same brutal way Hitler passed on his sickness, 

												    his hatred to German children in Aryan Youth programs; but still, thereäó»s something similar here, something stealth and disguised

												    like the fox dressed in sheepäó»s clothing. 
										        
											         * * *
										        
												   I hear, nowadays, these Indian mascots for schools and sporting teams 

												    are becoming a thing of the past, as Indian activists have been on the case for some time. I suppose that was inevitable; and something about this feels like a victory. 

												    But honestly, for me, this doesnäó»t satisfy

												    the past, the atrocities committed

												    in the name of Manifest Destiny Incorporated. 
												  æ
												  I say, if weäó»re going to eradicate these native Indian mascots, 

												    then why not replace them

												    with mascots that fit the spiritual values

												    of its country. 
												  æ
									            Letäó»s be downright bold, not just let things disappear. 
									            æ
												  Letäó»s paint a face of Ronald McDonald

												    on all the school walls across the country:

												    his smiling clown face and orange Afro hair. 

												    And maybe add a Nazi sign

												    on his forehead. 
												  æ
										        I think that would be more appropriate for the times.

Mythological

#######################################################

I 
GLOOM! 
An October like November; 
August a hundred thousand hours, 
And all September, 
A hundred thousand, dragging sunlit days, 
And half October like a thousand years . . . 
And doom! 
That then was Antwerp. . . 
                              In the name of God, 
How could they do it? 
Those souls that usually dived 
Into the dirty caverns of mines; 
Who usually hived 
In whitened hovels; under ragged poplars; 
Who dragged muddy shovels, over the grassy mud, 
Lumbering to work over the greasy sods. . . 
Those men there, with the appearance of clods 
Were the bravest men that a usually listless priest of God 
Ever shrived. . . 
And it is not for us to make them an anthem. 
If we found words there would come no wind that would fan them 
To a tune that the trumpets might blow it, 
Shrill through the heaven that's ours or yet Allah's, 
Or the wide halls of any Valhallas. 
We can make no such anthem. So that all that is ours 
For inditing in sonnets, pantoums, elegiacs, or lays 
Is this: 
In the name of God, how could they do it? 


II 
For there is no new thing under the sun, 
Only this uncomely man with a smoking gun 
In the gloom. . . 
What the devil will he gain by it? 
Digging a hole in the mud and standing all day in the rain by it 
Waiting his doom; 
The sharp blow, the swift outpouring of the blood, 
Till the trench of gray mud 
Is turned to a brown purple drain by it. 
Well, there have been scars 
Won in many wars . . .
Punic, 
Lacedmonian, wars of Napoleon, wars for faith, wars for honour, for love, for possession, 
But this Belgian man in his ugly tunic, 
His ugly round cap, shooting on, in a sort of obsession, 
Overspreading his miserable land, 
Standing with his wet gun in his hand . . . 
Doom! 
He finds that in a sudden scrimmage, 
And lies, an unsightly lump on the sodden grass . . . 
An image that shall take long to pass! 


III 
For the white-limbed heroes of Hellas ride by upon their horses 
Forever through our brains. 
The heroes of Cressy ride by upon their stallions; 
And battalions and battalions and battalions 
The Old Guard, the Young Guard, the men of Minden and of Waterloo, 
Pass, for ever staunch, 
Stand, for ever true; 
And the small man with the large paunch, 
And the gray coat, and the large hat, and the hands behind the back, 
Watches them pass 
In our minds for ever . . . 
But that clutter of sodden corses 
On the sodden Belgian grass 
That is a strange new beauty. 


IV 
With no especial legends of marchings or triumphs or duty, 
Assuredly that is the way of it, 
The way of beauty . . . 
And that is the highest word you can find to say of it. 
For you cannot praise it with words 
Compounded of lyres and swords, 
But the thought of the gloom and the rain 
And the ugly coated figure, standing beside a drain, 
Shall eat itself into your brain: 
And you will say of all heroes, They fought like the Belgians! 
And you will say: He wrought like a Belgian his fate out of gloom. 
And you will say: He bought like a Belgian his doom. 
And that shall be an honourable name; 
Belgian shall be an honourable word; 
As honourable as the fame of the sword, 
As honourable as the mention of the many-chorded lyre, 
And his old coat shall seem as beautiful as the fabrics woven in Tyre. 


V 
And what in the world did they bear it for? 
I don't know. 
And what in the world did they dare it for? 
Perhaps that is not for the likes of me to understand. 
They could very well have watched a hundred legions go 
Over their fields and between their cities 
Down into more southerly regions. 
They could very well have let the legions pass through their woods, 
And have kept their lives and their wives and their children and cattle and goods. 
I don't understand. 
Was it just love of their land? 
Oh, poor dears! 
Can any man so love his land? 
Give them a thousand thousand pities 
And rivers and rivers of tears 
To wash off the blood from the cities of Flanders. 


VI 
This is Charing Cross; 
It is midnight; 
There is a great crowd 
And no light. 
A great crowd, all black that hardly whispers aloud. 
Surely, that is a dead womana dead mother! 
She has a dead face; 
She is dressed all in black; 
She wanders to the bookstall and back, 
At the back of the crowd; 
And back again and again back, 
She sways and wanders. 

This is Charing Cross; 
It is one o'clock. 
There is still a great cloud, and very little light; 
Immense shafts of shadows over the black crowd 
That hardly whispers aloud. . . 
And now! .  . That is another dead mother, 
And there is another and another and another. . . 
And little children, all in black, 
All with dead faces, waiting in all the waiting-places, 
Wandering from the doors of the waiting-room 
In the dim gloom. 
These are the women of Flanders.
They await the lost. 
They await the lost that shall never leave the dock; 
They await the lost that shall never again come by the train 
To the embraces of all these women with dead faces; 
They await the lost who lie dead in trench and barrier and foss, 
In the dark of the night. 
This is Charing Cross; it is past one of the clock; 
There is very little light. 

There is so much pain. 


LEnvoi 
And it was for this that they endured this gloom; 
This October like November, 
That August like a hundred thousand hours, 
And that September, 
A hundred thousand dragging sunlit days, 
And half October like a thousand years. . . 
Oh, poor dears!



Love Poems

#######################################################

In our old shipwrecked days there was an hour,

												    When in the firelight steadily aglow,

												    Joined slackly, we beheld the red chasm grow

												    Among the clicking coals. Our library-bower

												    That eve was left to us: and hushed we sat

												    As lovers to whom Time is whispering.

												    From sudden-opened doors we heard them sing:

												    The nodding elders mixed good wine with chat.

												    Well knew we that Life's greatest treasure lay

												    With us, and of it was our talk. "Ah, yes!

												    Love dies!" I said: I never thought it less.

												    She yearned to me that sentence to unsay.

												    Then when the fire domed blackening, I found

												    Her cheek was salt against my kiss, and swift

												    Up the sharp scale of sobs her breast did lift:--

											    Now am I haunted by that taste! that sound!



Mythological

#######################################################

She was a village
Of lovely knowledge
The high roads left her aside, she was forlorn, a maid 
Water ran there, dusk hid her, she climbed four-wayed.
Brown-gold windows showed last folk not yet asleep;
Water ran, was a centre of silence deep,
Fathomless deeps of pricked sky, almost fathomless
Hallowed an upward gaze in pale satin of blue.
And I was happy indeed, of mind, soul, body even
Having got given
A sign undoubtful of a dear England few
Doubt, not many have seen,
That Will Squele he knew and was so shriven.
Home of Twelfth Night  Edward Thomas by Arras fallen,
Borrow and Hardy, Sussex tales out of Roman heights callen.
No madrigals or field-songs to my all reverent whim;
Till I got back I was dumb.

I see you with your bamboo rods

											      But I am far away.
												  æ
												  The waters of the K'e lie east,

												    And west the Ts'en-yuen.

												    But now I am a married wife,

												    And maid that is a wedded wife,

												    She comes not home again.
												  æ
												  The waters of the K'e lie east,

												    The Ts'en-yuen are west.

												    My white teeth flash, I smile on him,

												    These girdle-gems were given by him,

												    His wife is richly dressed.
												  æ
												  There in the river leaped a fish.

												    The oars dip in the K'e.

												    And then I might forget again,

I went to thank her,

											      That travellers had thrown,
												  æ
												  Who went to thank her;

												    But she slept.

												    'T was short to cross the sea

												    To look upon her like, alive,

												    But turning back 't was slow.

Seven nations stood with their hands on the jaws of death.

												    It was the first week in August, Nineteen Hundred Fourteen.

												    I was listening, you were listening, the whole world was listening,

												    And all of us heard a Voice murmuring:

"I am the way and the light,

												    He that believeth on me

												    Shall not perish

												    But shall have everlasting life."

												    Seven nations listening heard the Voice and answered:

"O Hell!"

												    The jaws of death began clicking and they go on clicking:

"O Hell!"



Narrative Poems

#######################################################

Robert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane

												    And Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,

												    Apparelled in magnificent attire,

												    With retinue of many a knight and squire,

												    On St. John's eve, at vespers, proudly sat

												    And heard the priests chant the Magnificat,

												    And as he listened, o'er and o'er again

												    Repeated, like a burden or refrain,

												    He caught the words, "Deposuit potentes

												    De sede, et exaltavit humiles;"

												    And slowly lifting up his kingly head

												    He to a learned clerk beside him said,

"What mean these words?"  The clerk made answer meet,

"He has put down the mighty from their seat,

And has exalted them of low degree."

												    Thereat King Robert muttered scornfully,

"'T is well that such seditious words are sung

												    Only by priests and in the Latin tongue;

												    For unto priests and people be it known,

												    There is no power can push me from my throne!"

												    And leaning back, he yawned and fell asleep,

											      Lulled by the chant monotonous and deep. 
												  æ
												  When he awoke, it was already night;

												    The church was empty, and there was no light,

												    Save where the lamps, that glimmered few and faint,

												    Lighted a little space before some saint.

												    He started from his seat and gazed around,

												    But saw no living thing and heard no sound.

												    He groped towards the door, but it was locked;

												    He cried aloud, and listened, and then knocked,

												    And uttered awful threatenings and complaints,

												    And imprecations upon men and saints.

												    The sounds reíchoed from the roof and walls

												    As if dead priests were laughing in their stalls. 
												  æ
												  At length the sexton, hearing from without

												    The tumult of the knocking and the shout,

												    And thinking thieves were in the house of prayer,

												    Came with his lantern, asking, "Who is there?"

												    Half choked with rage, King Robert fiercely said,

												    "Open: 't is I, the King!  Art thou afraid?"

												    The frightened sexton, muttering, with a curse,

												    "This is some drunken vagabond, or worse!"

												    Turned the great key and flung the portal wide;

												    A man rushed by him at a single stride,

												    Haggard, half naked, without hat or cloak,

												    Who neither turned, nor looked at him, nor spoke, 

												    But leaped into the blackness of the night,

												    And vanished like a spectre from his sight. 
												  æ
												  Robert of Sicily, brother of Pope Urbane

												    And Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,

												    Despoiled of his magnificent attire,

												    Bareheaded, breathless, and besprent with mire,

												    With sense of wrong and outrage desperate,

												    Strode on and thundered at the palace gate;

												    Rushed through the courtyard, thrusting in his rage

												    To right and left each seneschal and page,

												    And hurried up the broad and sounding stair,

												    His white face ghastly in the torches' glare.

												    From hall to hall he passed with breathless speed;

												    Voices and cries he heard, but did not heed,

												    Until at last he reached the banquet-room,

												    Blazing with light, and breathing with perfume. 
												  æ
												  There on the dais sat another king,

												    Wearing his robes, his crown, his signet-ring,

												    King Robert's self in features, form, and height,

												    But all transfigured with angelic light!

												    It was an Angel; and his presence there

												    With a divine effulgence filled the air,

												    An exaltation, piercing the disguise,

												    Though none the hidden Angel recognize. 
												  æ
												  A moment speechless, motionless, amazed,

												    The throneless monarch on the Angel gazed,

												    Who met his look of anger and surprise

												    With the divine compassion of his eyes;

												    Then said, "Who art thou? and why com'st thou here?"

												    To which King Robert answered, with a sneer,

												    "I am the King, and come to claim my own

												    From an impostor, who usurps my throne!"

												    And suddenly, at these audacious words,

												    Up sprang the angry guests, and drew their swords;

												    The Angel answered, with unruffled brow,

												    "Nay, not the King, but the King's Jester, thou

												    Henceforth shall wear the bells and scalloped cape,

												    And for thy counsellor shalt lead an ape;

												    Thou shalt obey my servants when they call,

												    And wait upon my henchmen in the hall!" 
												  æ
												  Deaf to King Robert's threats and cries and prayers,

												    They thrust him from the hall and down the stairs;

												    A group of tittering pages ran before,

												    And as they opened wide the folding-door,

												    His heart failed, for he heard, with strange alarms,

												    The boisterous laughter of the men-at-arms,

												    And all the vaulted chamber roar and ring

												    With the mock plaudits of "Long live the King!" 
												  æ
												  Next morning, waking with the day's first beam,

												    He said within himself, "It was a dream!"

												    But the straw rustled as he turned his head,

												    There were the cap and bells beside his bed,

												    Around him rose the bare, discolored walls,

												    Close by, the steeds were champing in their stalls,

												    And in the corner, a revolting shape,

												    Shivering and chattering sat the wretched ape.

												    It was no dream; the world he loved so much

												    Had turned to dust and ashes at his touch!
												  æ 
												  Days came and went; and now returned again

												    To Sicily the old Saturnian reign;

												    Under the Angel's governance benign

												    The happy island danced with corn and wine,

												    And deep within the mountain's burning breast

												    Enceladus, the giant, was at rest. 
												  æ
												  Meanwhile King Robert yielded to his fate,

												    Sullen and silent and disconsolate.

												    Dressed in the motley garb that Jesters wear,

												    With look bewildered and a vacant stare,

												    Close shaven above the ears, as monks are shorn,

												    By courtiers mocked, by pages laughed to scorn,

												    His only friend the ape, his only food

												    What others left,--he still was unsubdued.

												    And when the Angel met him on his way,

												    And half in earnest, half in jest, would say,

												    Sternly, though tenderly, that he might feel

												    The velvet scabbard held a sword of steel,

												    "Art thou the King?" the passion of his woe

												    Burst from him in resistless overflow,

												    And, lifting high his forehead, he would fling

												    The haughty answer back, "I am, I am the King!" 
												  æ
												  Almost three years were ended; when there came

												    Ambassadors of great repute and name

												    From Valmond, Emperor of Allemaine,

												    Unto King Robert, saying that Pope Urbane

												    By letter summoned them forthwith to come

												    On Holy Thursday to his city of Rome.

												    The Angel with great joy received his guests,

												    And gave them presents of embroidered vests,

												    And velvet mantles with rich ermine lined,

												    And rings and jewels of the rarest kind.

												    Then he departed with them o'er the sea

												    Into the lovely land of Italy,

												    Whose loveliness was more resplendent made

												    By the mere passing of that cavalcade,

												    With plumes, and cloaks, and housings, and the stir

												    Of jewelled bridle and of golden spur.

												    And lo! among the menials, in mock state,

												    Upon a piebald steed, with shambling gait,

												    His cloak of fox-tails flapping in the wind,

												    The solemn ape demurely perched behind,

												    King Robert rode, making huge merriment

												    In all the country towns through which they went. 
												  æ
												  The Pope received them with great pomp and blare

												    Of bannered trumpets, on Saint Peter's square,

												    Giving his benediction and embrace,

												    Fervent, and full of apostolic grace.

												    While with congratulations and with prayers

												    He entertained the Angel unawares,

												    Robert, the Jester, bursting through the crowd,

												    Into their presence rushed, and cried aloud,

												    "I am the King!  Look, and behold in me

												    Robert, your brother, King of Sicily!

												    This man, who wears my semblance to your eyes,

												    Is an impostor in a king's disguise.

												    Do you not know me? does no voice within

												    Answer my cry, and say we are akin?"

												    The Pope in silence, but with troubled mien,

												    Gazed at the Angel's countenance serene;

												    The Emperor, laughing, said, "It is strange sport

												    To keep a madman for thy Fool at court!"

												    And the poor, baffled Jester in disgrace

												    Was hustled back among the populace. 
												  æ
												  In solemn state the Holy Week went by,

												    And Easter Sunday gleamed upon the sky;

												    The presence of the Angel, with its light,

												    Before the sun rose, made the city bright,

												    And with new fervor filled the hearts of men,

												    Who felt that Christ indeed had risen again.

												    Even the Jester, on his bed of straw,

												    With haggard eyes the unwonted splendor saw,

												    He felt within a power unfelt before,

												    And, kneeling humbly on his chamber floor,

												    He heard the rushing garments of the Lord

												    Sweep through the silent air, ascending heavenward. 
												  æ
												  And now the visit ending, and once more

												    Valmond returning to the Danube's shore,

												    Homeward the Angel journeyed, and again

												    The land was made resplendent with his train,

												    Flashing along the towns of Italy

												    Unto Salerno, and from thence by sea.

												    And when once more within Palermo's wall,

												    And, seated on the throne in his great hall,

												    He heard the Angelus from convent towers,

												    As if the better world conversed with ours,

												    He beckoned to King Robert to draw nigher,

												    And with a gesture bade the rest retire;

												    And when they were alone, the Angel said,

												    "Art thou the King?"  Then, bowing down his head,

												    King Robert crossed both hands upon his breast,

												    And meekly answered him: "Thou knowest best!

												    My sins as scarlet are; let me go hence,

												    And in some cloister's school of penitence,

												    Across those stones, that pave the way to heaven,

												    Walk barefoot, till my guilty soul be shriven!" 
												  æ
												  The Angel smiled, and from his radiant face

												    A holy light illumined all the place,

												    And through the open window, loud and clear,

												    They heard the monks chant in the chapel near,

												    Above the stir and tumult of the street:

												    "He has put down the mighty from their seat,

												    And has exalted them of low degree!"

												    And through the chant a second melody

												    Rose like the throbbing of a single string:

												    "I am an Angel, and thou art the King!" 
												  æ
												  King Robert, who was standing near the throne,

												    Lifted his eyes, and lo! he was alone!

												    But all apparelled as in days of old,

												    With ermined mantle and with cloth of gold;

												    And when his courtiers came, they found him there

											    Kneeling upon the floor, absorbed in silent prayer.

I was the first fruits of the battle of Missionary Ridge.
When I felt the bullet enter my heart
I wished I had staid at home and gone to jail
For stealing the hogs of Curl Trenary,
Instead of running away and joining the army.
Rather a thousand times the county jail
Than to lie under this marble figure with wings,
And this granite pedestal Bearing the words, Pro Patria.
What do they mean, anyway?



Narrative Poems

Oh! young Lochinvar is come out of the west, 

												    Through all the wide Border his steed was the best; 

												    And save his good broadsword he weapons had none. 

												    He rode all unarmed and he rode all alone. 

												    So faithful in love and so dauntless in war, 

												    There never was knight like the young Lochinvar. 

                                                    

												    He stayed not for brake and he stopped not for stone, 

												    He swam the Eske river where ford there was none, 

												    But ere he alighted at Netherby gate 

												    The bride had consented, the gallant came late: 

												    For a laggard in love and a dastard in war 

												    Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar. 

                                                    

												    So boldly he entered the Netherby Hall, 

												    Among bridesmen, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all: 

												    Then spoke the bride's father, his hand on his sword,-- 

												    For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word,-- 

												    'Oh! come ye in peace here, or come ye in war, 

												    Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?'-- 

                                                    

												    'I long wooed your daughter, my suit you denied; 

												    Love swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide-- 

												    And now am I come, with this lost love of mine, 

												    To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine. 

												    There are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far, 

												    That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar.' 

                                                    

												    The bride kissed the goblet; the knight took it up, 

												    He quaffed off the wine, and he threw down the cup, 

												    She looked down to blush, and she looked up to sigh, 

												    With a smile on her lips and a tear in her eye. 

												    He took her soft hand ere her mother could bar,-- 

												    'Now tread we a measure!' said young Lochinvar. 

                                                    

												    So stately his form, and so lovely her face, 

												    That never a hall such a galliard did grace; 

												    While her mother did fret, and her father did fume, 

												    And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume; 

												    And the bride -- maidens whispered ''Twere better by far 

												    To have matched our fair cousin with young Lochinvar.' 

                                                    

												    One touch to her hand and one word in her ear, 

												    When they reached the hall-door, and the charger stood near; 

												    So light to the croupe the fair lady he swung, 

												    So light to the saddle before her he sprung! 

												    'She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur; 

												    They'll have fleet steeds that follow,' quoth young Lochinvar. 

                                                    

												    There was mounting 'mong Graemes of the Netherby clan; 

												    Fosters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran: 

												    There was racing and chasing on Cannobie Lee, 

												    But the lost bride of Netherby ne'er did they see. 

												    So daring in love and so dauntless in war, 

											      Have ye e'er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?



God Poems

They put up big wooden gods.

												    Then they burned the big wooden gods

												    And put up brass gods and

												    Changing their minds suddenly

												    Knocked down the brass gods and put up

												    A doughface god with gold earrings.

												    The poor mutts, the pathetic slant heads,

												    They didn't know a little tin god

												    Is as good as anything in the line of gods

												    Nor how a little tin god answers prayer

												    And makes rain and brings luck

												    The same as a big wooden god or a brass

												    God or a doughface god with golden

											      Earrings.



War Poems

#######################################################

Wherefore rock they, purgatorial shadows, 

												    Drooping tongues from jays that slob their relish, 

												    Baring teeth that leer like skulls' teeth wicked? 

												    Stroke on stroke of pain,- but what slow panic, 

												    Gouged these chasms round their fretted sockets? 

												    Ever from their hair and through their hands' palms 

												    Misery swelters. Surely we have perished 

												    Sleeping, and walk hell; but who these hellish?
											    æ 
												  -These are men whose minds the Dead have ravished. 

												    Memory fingers in their hair of murders, 

												    Multitudinous murders they once witnessed. 

												    Wading sloughs of flesh these helpless wander, 

												    Treading blood from lungs that had loved laughter. 

												    Always they must see these things and hear them, 

												    Batter of guns and shatter of flying muscles, 

												    Carnage incomparable, and human squander 

												    Rucked too thick for these men's extrication. 
												  æ
												  Therefore still their eyeballs shrink tormented 

												    Back into their brains, because on their sense 

												    Sunlight seems a blood-smear; night comes blood-black; 

												    Dawn breaks open like a wound that bleeds afresh. 

												    -Thus their heads wear this hilarious, hideous, 

												    Awful falseness of set-smiling corpses. 

												    -Thus their hands are plucking at each other; 

												    Picking at the rope-knouts of their scourging; 

												    Snatching after us who smote them, brother, 

												    Pawing us who dealt them war and madness.

Friend, your white beard sweeps the ground.

												    The triumphal march of Justice?

												    Do not wait, friend!

												    Take your white beard

												    And your old eyes

											      To more tender lands.



Silly Poems

#######################################################

The man who invented the women's waists that button down behind,

												    And the man who invented the cans with keys and the strips that will never wind,

												    Were put to sea in a leaky boat and with never a bite to eat

											      But a couple of dozen of patent cans in which was their only meat.
												  æ
												  And they sailed and sailed o'er the ocean wide and never they had a taste

												    Of aught to eat, for the cans stayed shut, and a peak-a-boo shirtwaist

												    Was all they had to bale the brine that came in the leaky boat;

												    And their tongues were thick and their throats were dry, and they barely kept afloat.
												  æ
												  They came at last to an island fair, and a man stood on the shore.

												    So they flew a signal of distress and their hopes rose high once more,

												    And they called to him to fetch a boat, for their craft was sinking fast,

												    And a couple of hours at best they knew was all their boat would last.
												  æ
												  So he called to them a cheery call and he said he would make haste,

												    But first he must go back to his wife and button up her waist,

												    Which would only take him an hour or so and then he would fetch a boat.

												    And the man who invented the backstairs waist, he groaned in his swollen throat.
												  æ
												  The hours passed by on leaden wings and they saw another man

												    In the window of a bungalow, and he held a tin meat can

												    In his bleeding hands, and they called to him, not once but twice and thrice,

												    And he said: "Just wait till I open this and I'll be there in a trice!"
												  æ
												  And the man who invented the patent cans he knew what the promise meant,

												    So he leaped in air with a horrid cry and into the sea he went,

												    And the bubbles rose where he sank and sank and a groan choked in the throat

											    Of the man who invented the backstairs waist and he sank with the leaky boat!

												  Hungry for control,

												    the dangfool god

												    gouges his own eye out

											    and drops it in the seedy well.

												  Then he gulps down

Narrative Poems

To drive Paul out of any lumber camp

												    All that was needed was to say to him,

"How is the wife, Paul?"--and he'd disappear.

												    Some said it was because be bad no wife,

												    And hated to be twitted on the subject;

												    Others because he'd come within a day

												    Or so of having one, and then been Jilted;

												    Others because he'd had one once, a good one,

												    Who'd run away with someone else and left him;

												    And others still because he had one now

												    He only had to be reminded of--

												    He was all duty to her in a minute:

												    He had to run right off to look her up,

												    As if to say, "That's so, how is my wife?

												    I hope she isn't getting into mischief."

												    No one was anxious to get rid of Paul.

												    He'd been the hero of the mountain camps

												    Ever since, just to show them, he had slipped

												    The bark of a whole tamarack off whole

												    As clean as boys do off a willow twig

												    To make a willow whistle on a Sunday

												    April by subsiding meadow brooks.

												    They seemed to ask him just to see him go,

"How is the wife, Paul?" and he always went.

												    He never stopped to murder anyone

												    Who asked the question. He just disappeared--

												    Nobody knew in what direction,

												    Although it wasn't usually long

												    Before they heard of him in some new camp,

												    The same Paul at the same old feats of logging.

												    The question everywhere was why should Paul

												    Object to being asked a civil question--

												    A man you could say almost anything to

												    Short of a fighting word. You have the answers.

												    And there was one more not so fair to Paul:

												    That Paul had married a wife not his equal.

												    Paul was ashamed of her. To match a hero

												    She would have had to be a heroine;

												    Instead of which she was some half-breed squaw.

												    But if the story Murphy told was true,

											      She wasn't anything to be ashamed of.
												  æ
												  You know Paul could do wonders. Everyone's

												    Heard how he thrashed the horses on a load

												    That wouldn't budge, until they simply stretched

												    Their rawhide harness from the load to camp.

												    Paul told the boss the load would be all right,

												    "The sun will bring your load in"--and it did--

												    By shrinking the rawhide to natural length.

												    That's what is called a stretcher. But I guess

												    The one about his jumping so's to land

												    With both his feet at once against the ceiling,

												    And then land safely right side up again,

												    Back on the floor, is fact or pretty near fact.

												    Well, this is such a yarn. Paul sawed his wife

												    Out of a white-pine log. Murphy was there

												    And, as you might say, saw the lady born.

												    Paul worked at anything in lumbering.

												    He'd been hard at it taking boards away

												    For--I forget--the last ambitious sawyer

												    To want to find out if he couldn't pile

												    The lumber on Paul till Paul begged for mercy.

												    They'd sliced the first slab off a big butt log,

												    And the sawyer had slammed the carriage back

												    To slam end-on again against the saw teeth.

												    To judge them by the way they caught themselves

												    When they saw what had happened to the log,

												    They must have had a guilty expectation

												    Something was going to go with their slambanging.

												    Something had left a broad black streak of grease

												    On the new wood the whole length of the log

												    Except, perhaps, a foot at either end.

												    But when Paul put his finger in the grease,

												    It wasn't grease at all, but a long slot.

												    The log was hollow. They were sawing pine.

												    "First time I ever saw a hollow pine.

												    That comes of having Paul around the place.

												    Take it to bell for me," the sawyer said.

												    Everyone had to have a look at it

												    And tell Paul what he ought to do about it.

												    (They treated it as his.) "You take a jackknife,

												    And spread the opening, and you've got a dugout

												    All dug to go a-fishing in." To Paul

												    The hollow looked too sound and clean and empty

												    Ever to have housed birds or beasts or bees.

												    There was no entrance for them to get in by.

												    It looked to him like some new kind of hollow

												    He thought he'd better take his jackknife to.

												    So after work that evening be came back

												    And let enough light into it by cutting

												    To see if it was empty. He made out in there

												    A slender length of pith, or was it pith?

												    It might have been the skin a snake had cast

												    And left stood up on end inside the tree

												    The hundred years the tree must have been growing.

												    More cutting and he had this in both hands,

												    And looking from it to the pond nearby,

												    Paul wondered how it would respond to water.

												    Not a breeze stirred, but just the breath of air

												    He made in walking slowly to the beach

												    Blew it once off his hands and almost broke it.

												    He laid it at the edge, where it could drink.

												    At the first drink it rustled and grew limp.

												    At the next drink it grew invisible.

												    Paul dragged the shallows for it with his fingers,

												    And thought it must have melted. It was gone.

												    And then beyond the open water, dim with midges,

												    Where the log drive lay pressed against the boom,

												    It slowly rose a person, rose a girl,

												    Her wet hair heavy on her like a helmet,

												    Who, leaning on a log, looked back at Paul.

												    And that made Paul in turn look back

												    To see if it was anyone behind him

												    That she was looking at instead of him.

												    (Murphy had been there watching all the time,

												    But from a shed where neither of them could see him.)

												    There was a moment of suspense in birth

												    When the girl seemed too waterlogged to live,

												    Before she caught her first breath with a gasp

												    And laughed. Then she climbed slowly to her feet,

												    And walked off, talking to herself or Paul,

												    Across the logs like backs of alligators,

												    Paul taking after her around the pond.
												  æ
												  Next evening Murphy and some other fellows

												    Got drunk, and tracked the pair up Catamount,

												    From the bare top of which there is a view

												    To other hills across a kettle valley.

												    And there, well after dark, let Murphy tell it,

												    They saw Paul and his creature keeping house.

												    It was the only glimpse that anyone

												    Has had of Paul and her since Murphy saw them

												    Falling in love across the twilight millpond.

												    More than a mile across the wilderness

												    They sat together halfway up a cliff

												    In a small niche let into it, the girl

												    Brightly, as if a star played on the place,

												    Paul darkly, like her shadow. All the light

												    Was from the girl herself, though, not from a star,

												    As was apparent from what happened next.

												    All those great ruffians put their throats together,

												    And let out a loud yell, and threw a bottle,

												    As a brute tribute of respect to beauty.

												    Of course the bottle fell short by a mile,

												    But the shout reached the girl and put her light out.

												    She went out like a firefly, and that was all.
												  æ
												  So there were witnesses that Paul was married

												    And not to anyone to be ashamed of

												    Everyone had been wrong in judging Paul.

												    Murphy told me Paul put on all those airs

												    About his wife to keep her to himself.

												    Paul was what's called a terrible possessor.

												    Owning a wife with him meant owning her.

												    She wasn't anybody else's business,

												    Either to praise her or much as name her,

												    And he'd thank people not to think of her.

												    Murphy's idea was that a man like Paul

												    Wouldn't be spoken to about a wife

											    In any way the world knew how to speak.

War Poems

#######################################################

Ten minutes now I have been looking at this.

												    I have gone by here before and wondered about it.

												    This is a bronze memorial of a famous general

												    Riding horseback with a flag and a sword and a revolver on him.

												    I want to smash the whole thing into a pile of junk to be hauled away to the scrap yard.

												    I put it straight to you,

												    After the farmer, the miner, the shop man, the factory hand, the fireman and the teamster,

												    Have all been remembered with bronze memorials,

												    Shaping them on the job of getting all of us

												    Something to eat and something to wear,

												    When they stack a few silhouettes

												    Against the sky

												    Here in the park,

												    And show the real huskies that are doing the work of the world, and feeding people instead of butchering them,

												    Then maybe I will stand here

												    And look easy at this general of the army holding a flag in the air,

												    And riding like hell on horseback

												    Ready to kill anybody that gets in his way,

												    Ready to run the red blood and slush the bowels of men all over the sweet new grass of the prairie.

(parts stolen from WWII letters)
											    
												   so we decided

												    the right time and all

												    you

												    a face and pictures

												    pictures

												    just one step more

												    curving over the same cliff

												    in the war i flew reconnaissance

												    no weapons

												    just watching

												    and pictures

												    taking pictures

												    all those trees

												    sacrificed 

												    to bomb the ammo dumps

												    we lived and died 

												    for the ammo dumps

												    and sometimes 

												    now

												    driving to work

												    i see those ammo dumps

												    hidden among the trees

												    and i call in the co-ordinates

Flower Poems

#######################################################

You write to me about roses,

												    About roses opening as roses die.

												    Always, you say, there are roses,

												    So that people get used to them

												    And cease to wonder.

												    Now I am on a hilltop,

												    Bare, with a few pine trees

												    Twisted by an inexhaustible wind,

												    By a wind that is never tired,

												    A wind that passes and passes and is never gone.

												    I cannot think what it would be like for the pine trees

											    If there were no wind.
												  æ
												  Your roses would not be happy on my hilltop.

												    They would be scornful of my huckleberry bushes

											    With their plain, blue fruit.
												  æ
										        They would not care for the white meadow-sweet

												    That leans against a rock.

												    Roses must have rich soil,

												    And careful pruning.

												    They must be sheltered from the wind and cold

												    And have stakes to lean upon.

												    They do not stand alone like the flames of vervain

												    On my windy hilltop.
										        æ
											    Roses are gifts for lovers.

												    Lovers have always had much to say about roses.

												    When you sent me a rose

												    Folded in a letter,

												    Did you know I would open it on a hilltop

												    Where the wind searches me

												    As it does the pine trees

												    And my skirts are brushing

												    The fine flame of the vervain?



Sad Poems

#######################################################

Sorrow like a ceaseless rain

												    Beats upon my heart.

												    People twist and scream in pain--

												    Dawn will find them still again;

												    This has neither wax nor wane,

											      Neither stop nor start.
												  æ
										        People dress and go to town;

												    I sit in my chair.

												    All my thoughts are slow and brown:

												    Standing up or sitting down

												    Little matters, or what gown

												    Or what shoes I wear.



Spring Poems

#######################################################

To what purpose, April, do you return again?

Beauty is not enough.

												    You can no longer quiet me with the redness

												    Of little leaves opening stickily.

												    I know what I know.

												    The sun is hot on my neck as I observe

												    The spikes of the crocus.

												    The smell of the earth is good.

												    It is apparent that there is no death.

												    But what does that signify?

												    Not only under ground are the brains of men

												    Eaten by maggots.

Life in itself

												    Is nothing,

												    An empty cup, a flight of uncarpeted stairs.

												    It is not enough that yearly, down this hill,

												    April

											      Comes like an idiot, babbling and strewing flowers.



War Poems

I knew a simple soldier boy

												    Who grinned at life in empty joy,

												    Slept soundly through the lonesome dark,

											      And whistled early with the lark.
												  æ
								                In winter trenches, cowed and glum,

												    With crumps and lice and lack of rum,

												    He put a bullet through his brain.

												    No one spoke of him again.
								                æ
											    You snug-faced crowds with kindling eye

												    Who cheer when soldier lads march by,

												    Sneak home and pray you'll never know

												    The hell where youth and laughter go.

War Poems

No doubt they'll soon get well; the shock and strain

												    Have caused their stammering, disconnected talk.

												    Of course they're "longing to go out again,"--

												    These boys with old, scared faces, learning to walk,

												    They'll soon forget their haunted nights; their cowed

												    Subjection to the ghosts of friends who died--

												    Their dreams that drip with murder; and they'll be proud

												    Of glorious war that shatter'd all their pride ...

												    Men who went out to battle, grim and glad;

											      Children with eyes that hate you, broken and mad.



Narrative Poems

#######################################################

A drifting, April, twilight sky,

												    A wind which blew the puddles dry,

												    And slapped the river into waves

												    That ran and hid among the staves

												    Of an old wharf.  A watery light

												    Touched bleak the granite bridge, and white

												    Without the slightest tinge of gold,

												    The city shivered in the cold.

												    All day my thoughts had lain as dead,

												    Unborn and bursting in my head.

												    From time to time I wrote a word

												    Which lines and circles overscored.

												    My table seemed a graveyard, full

												    Of coffins waiting burial.

												    I seized these vile abortions, tore

												    Them into jagged bits, and swore

												    To be the dupe of hope no more.

												    Into the evening straight I went,

												    Starved of a day's accomplishment.

												    Unnoticing, I wandered where

												    The city gave a space for air,

												    And on the bridge's parapet

												    I leant, while pallidly there set

												    A dim, discouraged, worn-out sun.

												    Behind me, where the tramways run,

												    Blossomed bright lights, I turned to leave,

												    When someone plucked me by the sleeve.

"Your pardon, Sir, but I should be

												    Most grateful could you lend to me

												    A carfare, I have lost my purse."

												    The voice was clear, concise, and terse.

												    I turned and met the quiet gaze

											      Of strange eyes flashing through the haze.
												  æ
												  The man was old and slightly bent,

												    Under his cloak some instrument

												    Disarranged its stately line,

												    He rested on his cane a fine

												    And nervous hand, an almandine

												    Smouldered with dull-red flames, sanguine

												    It burned in twisted gold, upon

												    His finger.  Like some Spanish don,

												    Conferring favours even when

												    Asking an alms, he bowed again

												    And waited.  But my pockets proved

												    Empty, in vain I poked and shoved,

												    No hidden penny lurking there

												    Greeted my search.  "Sir, I declare

												    I have no money, pray forgive,

												    But let me take you where you live."

												    And so we plodded through the mire

												    Where street lamps cast a wavering fire.

												    I took no note of where we went,

												    His talk became the element

												    Wherein my being swam, content.

												    It flashed like rapiers in the night

												    Lit by uncertain candle-light,

												    When on some moon-forsaken sward

												    A quarrel dies upon a sword.

												    It hacked and carved like a cutlass blade,

												    And the noise in the air the broad words made

												    Was the cry of the wind at a window-pane

												    On an Autumn night of sobbing rain.

												    Then it would run like a steady stream

												    Under pinnacled bridges where minarets gleam,

												    Or lap the air like the lapping tide

												    Where a marble staircase lifts its wide

												    Green-spotted steps to a garden gate,

												    And a waning moon is sinking straight

												    Down to a black and ominous sea,

												    While a nightingale sings in a lemon tree.
												  æ
												  I walked as though some opiate

												    Had stung and dulled my brain, a state

												    Acute and slumbrous.  It grew late.

												    We stopped, a house stood silent, dark.

												    The old man scratched a match, the spark

												    Lit up the keyhole of a door,

												    We entered straight upon a floor

												    White with finest powdered sand

												    Carefully sifted, one might stand

												    Muddy and dripping, and yet no trace

												    Would stain the boards of this kitchen-place.

												    From the chimney, red eyes sparked the gloom,

												    And a cricket's chirp filled all the room.

												    My host threw pine-cones on the fire

												    And crimson and scarlet glowed the pyre

												    Wrapped in the golden flame's desire.

												    The chamber opened like an eye,

												    As a half-melted cloud in a Summer sky

												    The soul of the house stood guessed, and shy

												    It peered at the stranger warily.

												    A little shop with its various ware

												    Spread on shelves with nicest care.

												    Pitchers, and jars, and jugs, and pots,

												    Pipkins, and mugs, and many lots

												    Of lacquered canisters, black and gold,

												    Like those in which Chinese tea is sold.

												    Chests, and puncheons, kegs, and flasks,

												    Goblets, chalices, firkins, and casks.

												    In a corner three ancient amphorae leaned

												    Against the wall, like ships careened.

												    There was dusky blue of Wedgewood ware,

												    The carved, white figures fluttering there

												    Like leaves adrift upon the air.

												    Classic in touch, but emasculate,

												    The Greek soul grown effeminate.

												    The factory of Sevres had lent

												    Elegant boxes with ornament

												    Culled from gardens where fountains splashed

												    And golden carp in the shadows flashed,

												    Nuzzling for crumbs under lily-pads,

												    Which ladies threw as the last of fads.

												    Eggshell trays where gay beaux knelt,

												    Hand on heart, and daintily spelt

												    Their love in flowers, brittle and bright,

												    Artificial and fragile, which told aright

												    The vows of an eighteenth-century knight.

												    The cruder tones of old Dutch jugs

												    Glared from one shelf, where Toby mugs

												    Endlessly drank the foaming ale,

												    Its froth grown dusty, awaiting sale.

												    The glancing light of the burning wood

												    Played over a group of jars which stood

												    On a distant shelf, it seemed the sky

												    Had lent the half-tones of his blazonry

												    To paint these porcelains with unknown hues

												    Of reds dyed purple and greens turned blues,

												    Of lustres with so evanescent a sheen

												    Their colours are felt, but never seen.

												    Strange winged dragons writhe about

												    These vases, poisoned venoms spout,

												    Impregnate with old Chinese charms;

												    Sealed urns containing mortal harms,

												    They fill the mind with thoughts impure,

												    Pestilent drippings from the ure

												    Of vicious thinkings.  "Ah, I see,"

												    Said I, "you deal in pottery."

												    The old man turned and looked at me.

												    Shook his head gently.  "No," said he.
												  æ
												  Then from under his cloak he took the thing

												    Which I had wondered to see him bring

												    Guarded so carefully from sight.

												    As he laid it down it flashed in the light,

												    A Toledo blade, with basket hilt,

												    Damascened with arabesques of gilt,

												    Or rather gold, and tempered so

												    It could cut a floating thread at a blow.

												    The old man smiled, "It has no sheath,

												    'Twas a little careless to have it beneath

												    My cloak, for a jostle to my arm

												    Would have resulted in serious harm.

												    But it was so fine, I could not wait,

												    So I brought it with me despite its state."

												    "An amateur of arms," I thought,

												    "Bringing home a prize which he has bought."

												    "You care for this sort of thing, Dear Sir?"

												    "Not in the way which you infer.

												    I need them in business, that is all."

												    And he pointed his finger at the wall.

												    Then I saw what I had not noticed before.

												    The walls were hung with at least five score

												    Of swords and daggers of every size

												    Which nations of militant men could devise.

												    Poisoned spears from tropic seas,

												    That natives, under banana trees,

												    Smear with the juice of some deadly snake.

												    Blood-dipped arrows, which savages make

												    And tip with feathers, orange and green,

												    A quivering death, in harlequin sheen.

												    High up, a fan of glancing steel

												    Was formed of claymores in a wheel.

												    Jewelled swords worn at kings' levees

												    Were suspended next midshipmen's dirks, and these

												    Elbowed stilettos come from Spain,

												    Chased with some splendid Hidalgo's name.

												    There were Samurai swords from old Japan,

												    And scimitars from Hindoostan,

												    While the blade of a Turkish yataghan

												    Made a waving streak of vitreous white

												    Upon the wall, in the firelight.

												    Foils with buttons broken or lost

												    Lay heaped on a chair, among them tossed

												    The boarding-pike of a privateer.

												    Against the chimney leaned a queer

												    Two-handed weapon, with edges dull

												    As though from hacking on a skull.

												    The rusted blood corroded it still.

												    My host took up a paper spill

												    From a heap which lay in an earthen bowl,

												    And lighted it at a burning coal.

												    At either end of the table, tall

												    Wax candles were placed, each in a small,

												    And slim, and burnished candlestick

												    Of pewter.  The old man lit each wick,

												    And the room leapt more obviously

												    Upon my mind, and I could see

												    What the flickering fire had hid from me.

												    Above the chimney's yawning throat,

												    Shoulder high, like the dark wainscote,

												    Was a mantelshelf of polished oak

												    Blackened with the pungent smoke

												    Of firelit nights; a Cromwell clock

												    Of tarnished brass stood like a rock

												    In the midst of a heaving, turbulent sea

												    Of every sort of cutlery.

												    There lay knives sharpened to any use,

												    The keenest lancet, and the obtuse

												    And blunted pruning bill-hook; blades

												    Of razors, scalpels, shears; cascades

												    Of penknives, with handles of mother-of-pearl,

												    And scythes, and sickles, and scissors; a whirl

												    Of points and edges, and underneath

												    Shot the gleam of a saw with bristling teeth.

												    My head grew dizzy, I seemed to hear

												    A battle-cry from somewhere near,

												    The clash of arms, and the squeal of balls,

												    And the echoless thud when a dead man falls.

												    A smoky cloud had veiled the room,

												    Shot through with lurid glares; the gloom

												    Pounded with shouts and dying groans,

												    With the drip of blood on cold, hard stones.

												    Sabres and lances in streaks of light

												    Gleamed through the smoke, and at my right

												    A creese, like a licking serpent's tongue,

												    Glittered an instant, while it stung.

												    Streams, and points, and lines of fire!

												    The livid steel, which man's desire

												    Had forged and welded, burned white and cold.

												    Every blade which man could mould,

												    Which could cut, or slash, or cleave, or rip,

												    Or pierce, or thrust, or carve, or strip,

												    Or gash, or chop, or puncture, or tear,

												    Or slice, or hack, they all were there.

												    Nerveless and shaking, round and round,

												    I stared at the walls and at the ground,

												    Till the room spun like a whipping top,

												    And a stern voice in my ear said, "Stop!

												    I sell no tools for murderers here.

												    Of what are you thinking!  Please clear

												    Your mind of such imaginings.

												    Sit down.  I will tell you of these things."
												  æ
												  He pushed me into a great chair

												    Of russet leather, poked a flare

												    Of tumbling flame, with the old long sword,

												    Up the chimney; but said no word.

												    Slowly he walked to a distant shelf,

												    And brought back a crock of finest delf.

												    He rested a moment a blue-veined hand

												    Upon the cover, then cut a band

												    Of paper, pasted neatly round,

												    Opened and poured.  A sliding sound

												    Came from beneath his old white hands,

												    And I saw a little heap of sands,

												    Black and smooth.  What could they be:

												    "Pepper," I thought.  He looked at me.

												    "What you see is poppy seed.

												    Lethean dreams for those in need."

												    He took up the grains with a gentle hand

												    And sifted them slowly like hour-glass sand.

												    On his old white finger the almandine

												    Shot out its rays, incarnadine.

												    "Visions for those too tired to sleep.

												    These seeds cast a film over eyes which weep.

												    No single soul in the world could dwell,

												    Without these poppy-seeds I sell."

												    For a moment he played with the shining stuff,

												    Passing it through his fingers.  Enough

												    At last, he poured it back into

												    The china jar of Holland blue,

												    Which he carefully carried to its place.

												    Then, with a smile on his aged face,

												    He drew up a chair to the open space

												    'Twixt table and chimney.  "Without preface,

												    Young man, I will say that what you see

												    Is not the puzzle you take it to be."

												    "But surely, Sir, there is something strange

												    In a shop with goods at so wide a range

												    Each from the other, as swords and seeds.

												    Your neighbours must have greatly differing needs."

												    "My neighbours," he said, and he stroked his chin,

												    "Live everywhere from here to Pekin.

												    But you are wrong, my sort of goods

												    Is but one thing in all its moods."

												    He took a shagreen letter case

												    From his pocket, and with charming grace

												    Offered me a printed card.

												    I read the legend, "Ephraim Bard.

												    Dealer in Words."  And that was all.

												    I stared at the letters, whimsical

												    Indeed, or was it merely a jest.

												    He answered my unasked request:

												    "All books are either dreams or swords,

												    You can cut, or you can drug, with words.

												    My firm is a very ancient house,

												    The entries on my books would rouse

												    Your wonder, perhaps incredulity.

												    I inherited from an ancestry

												    Stretching remotely back and far,

												    This business, and my clients are

												    As were those of my grandfather's days,

												    Writers of books, and poems, and plays.

												    My swords are tempered for every speech,

												    For fencing wit, or to carve a breach

												    Through old abuses the world condones.

												    In another room are my grindstones and hones,

												    For whetting razors and putting a point

												    On daggers, sometimes I even anoint

												    The blades with a subtle poison, so

												    A twofold result may follow the blow.

												    These are purchased by men who feel

												    The need of stabbing society's heel,

												    Which egotism has brought them to think

												    Is set on their necks.  I have foils to pink

												    An adversary to quaint reply,

												    And I have customers who buy

												    Scalpels with which to dissect the brains

												    And hearts of men.  Ultramundanes

												    Even demand some finer kinds

												    To open their own souls and minds.

												    But the other half of my business deals

												    With visions and fancies.  Under seals,

												    Sorted, and placed in vessels here,

												    I keep the seeds of an atmosphere.

												    Each jar contains a different kind

												    Of poppy seed.  From farthest Ind

												    Come the purple flowers, opium filled,

												    From which the weirdest myths are distilled;

												    My orient porcelains contain them all.

												    Those Lowestoft pitchers against the wall

												    Hold a lighter kind of bright conceit;

												    And those old Saxe vases, out of the heat

												    On that lowest shelf beside the door,

												    Have a sort of Ideal, "couleur d'or".

												    Every castle of the air

												    Sleeps in the fine black grains, and there

												    Are seeds for every romance, or light

												    Whiff of a dream for a summer night.

												    I supply to every want and taste."

												    'Twas slowly said, in no great haste

												    He seemed to push his wares, but I

												    Dumfounded listened.  By and by

												    A log on the fire broke in two.

												    He looked up quickly, "Sir, and you?"

												    I groped for something I should say;

												    Amazement held me numb.  "To-day

												    You sweated at a fruitless task."

												    He spoke for me, "What do you ask?

												    How can I serve you?"  "My kind host,

												    My penniless state was not a boast;

												    I have no money with me."  He smiled.

												    "Not for that money I beguiled

												    You here; you paid me in advance."

												    Again I felt as though a trance

												    Had dimmed my faculties.  Again

												    He spoke, and this time to explain.

												    "The money I demand is Life,

												    Your nervous force, your joy, your strife!"

												    What infamous proposal now

												    Was made me with so calm a brow?

												    Bursting through my lethargy,

												    Indignantly I hurled the cry:

												    "Is this a nightmare, or am I

												    Drunk with some infernal wine?

												    I am no Faust, and what is mine

												    Is what I call my soul!  Old Man!

												    Devil or Ghost!  Your hellish plan

												    Revolts me.  Let me go."  "My child,"

												    And the old tones were very mild,

												    "I have no wish to barter souls;

												    My traffic does not ask such tolls.

												    I am no devil; is there one?

												    Surely the age of fear is gone.

												    We live within a daylight world

												    Lit by the sun, where winds unfurled

												    Sweep clouds to scatter pattering rain,

												    And then blow back the sun again.

												    I sell my fancies, or my swords,

												    To those who care far more for words,

												    Ideas, of which they are the sign,

												    Than any other life-design.

												    Who buy of me must simply pay

												    Their whole existence quite away:

												    Their strength, their manhood, and their prime,

												    Their hours from morning till the time

												    When evening comes on tiptoe feet,

												    And losing life, think it complete;

												    Must miss what other men count being,

												    To gain the gift of deeper seeing;

												    Must spurn all ease, all hindering love,

												    All which could hold or bind; must prove

												    The farthest boundaries of thought,

												    And shun no end which these have brought;

												    Then die in satisfaction, knowing

												    That what was sown was worth the sowing.

												    I claim for all the goods I sell

												    That they will serve their purpose well,

												    And though you perish, they will live.

												    Full measure for your pay I give.

												    To-day you worked, you thought, in vain.

												    What since has happened is the train

												    Your toiling brought.  I spoke to you

												    For my share of the bargain, due."

												    "My life!  And is that all you crave

												    In pay?  What even childhood gave!

												    I have been dedicate from youth.

												    Before my God I speak the truth!"

												    Fatigue, excitement of the past

												    Few hours broke me down at last.

												    All day I had forgot to eat,

												    My nerves betrayed me, lacking meat.

												    I bowed my head and felt the storm

												    Plough shattering through my prostrate form.

												    The tearless sobs tore at my heart.

												    My host withdrew himself apart;

												    Busied among his crockery,

												    He paid no farther heed to me.

												    Exhausted, spent, I huddled there,

												    Within the arms of the old carved chair.
												  æ
												  A long half-hour dragged away,

												    And then I heard a kind voice say,

												    "The day will soon be dawning, when

												    You must begin to work again.

												    Here are the things which you require."

												    By the fading light of the dying fire,

												    And by the guttering candle's flare,

												    I saw the old man standing there.

												    He handed me a packet, tied

												    With crimson tape, and sealed.  "Inside

												    Are seeds of many differing flowers,

												    To occupy your utmost powers

												    Of storied vision, and these swords

												    Are the finest which my shop affords.

												    Go home and use them; do not spare

												    Yourself; let that be all your care.

												    Whatever you have means to buy

												    Be very sure I can supply."

												    He slowly walked to the window, flung

												    It open, and in the grey air rung

												    The sound of distant matin bells.

												    I took my parcels.  Then, as tells

												    An ancient mumbling monk his beads,

												    I tried to thank for his courteous deeds

												    My strange old friend.  "Nay, do not talk,"

												    He urged me, "you have a long walk

												    Before you.  Good-by and Good-day!"

												    And gently sped upon my way

												    I stumbled out in the morning hush,

												    As down the empty street a flush

												    Ran level from the rising sun.

												    Another day was just begun.

Sad Poems

#######################################################

An old lady, who was present at the execution of Ruth Blay, said, as Ruth was carried through the streets, her shrieks filled the air. She was dressed in silk, and was driven under the gallows in a cart. Public sympathy was awakened for her, and her friends had procured from the governor a reprieve, which would have soon resulted in her pardon; for circumstances afterwards showed that her concealed child was probably still-born, and she was no murderess. The hour for her execution arrived, and the sheriff, not wishing, it is said, to be late to his dinner, ordered the cart to be driven away, and the unfortunate woman was left hanging from the gallows, a sacrifice to misguided judgment. If we are rightly informed, she was a girl of good education for her day, having been a school-mistress. The indignation of the populace can hardly be conceived when it was ascertained that a reprieve from the governor came a few minutes after her spirit had been hastened away. --RAMBLES ABOUT PORTSMOUTH
											    
												  In the worn and dusty annals

												    Of our old and quiet town,

												    With its streets of leafy beauty,

											    And its houses quaint and brown,--
												  æ
												  With its dear associations,

												    Hallowed by the touch of Time,--

												    You may read this thrilling legend,

											    This sad tale of wrong and crime.
												  æ
												  In the drear month of December,

												    Ninety years ago today,

												    Hundreds of the village people

											    Saw the hanging of Ruth Blay;--
												  æ
												  Saw her, clothed in silk and satin,

												    Borne beneath the gallows-tree,

												    Dressed as in her wedding garments,

											    Soon the bride of Death to be;--
												  æ
												  Saw her tears of shame and anguish,

												    Heard her shrieks of wild despair

												    Echo through the neighboring woodlands,

											    Thrill the clear and frosty air;--
												  æ
												  Till their hearts were moved to pity

												    At her fear and agony:

												    "Doomed to die," they said, "unjustly,

											    Weak, but innocent is she."
												  æ
												  When at last, in tones of warning,

												    From its high and airy tower,

												    Slowly, with its tongue of iron,

											    Tolled the bell the fatal hour.
												  æ
												  Like the sound of distant billows,

												    When the storm is wild and loud,

												    Breaking on the rocky headlands,

											    Ran a murmur through the crowd.
												  æ
												  And a voice among them shouted,

												    "Pause before the deed is done;

												    We have asked reprieve and pardon

											    For the poor, misguided one."
												  æ
												  But these words of Sheriff Packer

												    Rang above the swelling noise:

												    "Must I wait and lose my dinner?

											    Draw away the cart, my boys!"
												  æ
												  Fold thy hands in prayer, O woman!

												    Take thy last look of the sea;

												    Take thy last look of the landscape;

											    God be merciful to thee!
												  æ
												  Stifled groans, a gasp, a shudder,

												    And the guilty deed was done;

												    On a scene of cruel murder

											    Coldly looked the Winter sun.
												  æ
												  Then the people, pale with horror,

												    Looked with sudden awe behind,

												    As a field of grain in Autumn

											    Turns before a passing wind;
												  æ
												  For distinctly in the distance,

												    In the long and frozen street,

												    They could hear the ringing echoes

											    Of a horse's sounding feet.
												  æ
												  Nearer came the sound and louder,

												    Till a steed with panting breath,

												    From its sides the white foam dripping,

											    Halted at the scene of death;
												  æ
												  And a messenger alighted,

												    Crying to the crowd, "Make way!

												    This I bear to Sheriff Packer;

											    'Tis a pardon for Ruth Blay!"
												  æ
												  But they answered not nor heeded,

												    For the last fond hope had fled;

												    In their deep and speechless sorrow,

											    Pointing only to the dead.
												  æ
										        And that night, with burning bosoms,

												    Muttering curses fierce and loud,

												    At the house of Sheriff Packer

												    Gathered the indignant crowd,--
										        æ
											    Shouting, as upon a gallows

												    A grim effigy they bore,

												    "Be the name of Thomas Packer

												    A reproach forevermore!"



Narrative Poems

#######################################################

It was a tall young oysterman lived by the river-side,

												    His shop was just upon the bank, his boat was on the tide;

												    The daughter of a fisherman, that was so straight and slim,

											      Lived over on the other bank, right opposite to him.
												  æ
												  It was the pensive oysterman that saw a lovely maid,

												    Upon a moonlight evening, a sitting in the shade;

												    He saw her wave her handkerchief, as much as if to say,

												    "I 'm wide awake, young oysterman, and all the folks away."
												  æ
												  Then up arose the oysterman, and to himself said he,

												    "I guess I 'll leave the skiff at home, for fear that folks should see

												    I read it in the story-book, that, for to kiss his dear,

												    Leander swam the Hellespont,--and I will swim this here."
												  æ
												  And he has leaped into the waves, and crossed the shining stream,

												    And he has clambered up the bank, all in the moonlight gleam;

												    Oh there were kisses sweet as dew, and words as soft as rain,--

												    But they have heard her father's step, and in he leaps again!
												  æ
												  Out spoke the ancient fisherman,--"Oh, what was that, my daughter?"

												    "'T was nothing but a pebble, sir, I threw into the water."

												    "And what is that, pray tell me, love, that paddles off so fast?"

												    "It's nothing but a porpoise, sir, that 's been a swimming past."
												  æ
												  Out spoke the ancient fisherman,--"Now bring me my harpoon!

												    I'll get into my fishing-boat, and fix the fellow soon."

												    Down fell that pretty innocent, as falls a snow-white lamb,

												    Her hair drooped round her pallid cheeks, like sea-weed on a clam.
												  æ
												  Alas for those two loving ones! she waked not from her swound,

												    And he was taken with the cramp, and in the waves was drowned;

												    But Fate has metamorphosed them, in pity of their woe,

											    And now they keep an oyster-shop for mermaids down below.



War Poems

#######################################################

With pennons flying, and with trumpets' blare,

												    And noise of pipes, Venetian galleys swept

												    Into the Adriatic, Dandolo,

												    In stately flagships leading; Genoa,

												    Proud, hating Venice, eager for the fight,

												    Was ready when the Sunday sun should dawn,

												    To meet the foe; on came the brilliant fleet,

												    The morning sun bathing them all in gold,

												    Hurling their crossbows at the Genoese;

												    And back came showers of arrows, iron, fire-tipped,

												    To blaze among the rigging, and quick-lime

												    To blind their eyes as though a dagger's point

												    Had pierced them; but so furious the attack

												    That ten brave galleys of the Genoese,

												    All red with gore, were captured. Doria,

												    The friend of Genoa, famed in peace and war,

												    Stood watching the dread conflict, sick at heart,

												    That Italy's best blood was spilled in vain.

												    At the forecastle stood his eldest son,

												    Octavian, worthy of his noble line,

												    Fearless and foremost in the rain of spears;

												    When lo! an arrow entered the young heart,

												    And, horror-stricken, every face grew pale.

												    What need to battle longer with the foe?

												    But Lamba Doria sprang across the ship,

												    And raised the dead young soldier to his breast,

												    Still warm beneath his armor: "Ah! my son,

												    If thou hadst died at home thou couldst not have

												    A burial place more splendid than the sea;"

												    And pressing close the one he idolized,

												    He cast the body to the seething waves,

												    And saw it sink forever. Then he bade

												    His weeping comrades seize their spears again,

												    And fight the braver for Octavian's death.

												    Woe turned to fierceness, and with wildest zeal,

												    And recking not whether they lived or died,

												    They slew Venetians till the sun went down.

												    Seven thousand men were captured and in chains;

												    Venice was humbled; one, in proud despair,

												    Her leader, Dandalo, refused to live,

												    And ended his existence; Genoa gave

												    A noble burial to her valiant foe.

												    The battle of Cuzzola conquered peace

												    Between the two Republics; many gifts

												    Of palaces and honors for his line

												    Were given Lamba Doria, but his gift,

												    With love of country burning in his heart,

												    Exceeded all his state could offer him:

											      The life of his beloved Octavian.



War Poems

#######################################################

Oh! wherefore come ye forth in triumph from the north, 

												    With your hands, and your feet, and your raiment all red? 

												    And wherefore doth your rout send forth a joyous shout? 

											      And whence be the grapes of the wine-press that ye tread? 
												  æ
												  Oh! evil was the root, and bitter was the fruit, 

												    And crimson was the juice of the vintage that we trod; 

												    For we trampled on the throng of the haughty and the strong, 

												    Who sate in the high places and slew the saints of God. 
												  æ
												  It was about the noon of a glorious day of June, 

												    That we saw their banners dance and their cuirasses shine, 

												    And the man of blood was there, with his long essenced hair, 

												    And Astley, and Sir Marmaduke, and Rupert of the Rhine. 
												  æ
												  Like a servant of the Lord, with his Bible and his sword, 

												    The general rode along us to form us for the fight; 

												    When a murmuring sound broke out, and swelled into a shout 

												    Among the godless horsemen upon the tyrant's right. 
												  æ
												  And hark! like the roar of the billows on the shore, 

												    The cry of battle rises along their charging line: 

												    For God! for the Cause! for the Church! for the laws! 

												    For Charles, king of England, and Rupert of the Rhine! 
												  æ
												  The furious German comes, with his clarions and his drums, 

												    His bravoes of Alsatia and pages of Whitehall; 

												    They are bursting on our flanks! Grasp your pikes! Close your ranks! 

												    For Rupert never comes, but to conquer or to fall. 
												  æ
												  They are here -- they rush on -- we are broken -- we are gone -- 

												    Our left is borne before them like stubble on the blast. 

												    O Lord, put forth thy might! O Lord, defend the right! 

												    Stand back to back, in God's name! and fight it to the last! 
												  æ
												  Stout Skippen hath a wound -- the centre hath given ground. 

												    Hark! Hark! what means the trampling of horsemen on our rear? 

												    Whose banner do I see, boys? 'Tis he! thank God! 'tis he, boys! 

												    Bear up another minute! Brave Oliver is here! 
												  æ
												  Their heads all stooping low, their points all in a row: 

												    Like a whirlwind on the trees, like a deluge on the dikes, 

												    Our cuirassiers have burst on the ranks of the accurst, 

												    And at a shock have scattered the forest of his pikes. 
												  æ
												  Fast, fast, the gallants ride, in some safe nook to hide 

												    Their coward heads, predestined to rot on Temple Bar; 

												    And he -- he turns! he flies! shame on those cruel eyes 

												    That bore to look on torture, and dare not look on war! 
												  æ
												  Ho, comrades! scour the plain; and ere ye strip the slain, 

												    First give another stab to make your search secure; 

												    Then shake from sleeves and pockets their broad-pieces and lockets, 

												    The tokens of the wanton, the plunder of the poor. 
												  æ
												  Fools! your doublets shone with gold, and your hearts were gay and bold, 

												    When you kissed your lily hands to your lemans to-day; 

												    And to-morrow shall the fox from her chambers in the rocks 

												    Lead forth her tawny cubs to howl above the prey. 
												  æ
												  Where be your tongues, that late mocked at heaven, and hell, and fate? 

												    And the fingers that once were so busy with your blades? 

												    Your perfumed satin clothes, your catches and your oaths? 

												    Your stage plays and your sonnets, your diamonds and your spades? 
												  æ
												  Down! down! forever down, with the mitre and the crown! 

												    With the Belial of the court, and the Mammon of the Pope! 

												    There is woe in Oxford halls, there is wail in Durham's stalls; 

												    The Jesuit smites his bosom, the bishop rends his cope. 
												  æ
												  And she of the seven hills shall mourn her children's ills, 

												    And tremble when she thinks on the edge of England's sword; 

												    And the kings of earth in fear shall shudder when they hear 

											    What the hand of God hath wrought for the houses and the word!

Half a league, half a league,

												    Half a league onward,

												    All in the valley of Death

												    Rode the six hundred.

"Forward, the Light Brigade!

"Charge for the guns!" he said:

												    Into the valley of Death

											      Rode the six hundred.
												  æ
												  "Forward, the Light Brigade!"

												    Was there a man dismay'd?

												    Not tho' the soldier knew

												    Someone had blunder'd:

												    Theirs not to make reply,

												    Theirs not to reason why,

												    Theirs but to do and die:

												    Into the valley of Death

												    Rode the six hundred.
												  æ
												  Cannon to right of them,

												    Cannon to left of them,

												    Cannon in front of them

												    Volley'd and thunder'd;

												    Storm'd at with shot and shell,

												    Boldly they rode and well,

												    Into the jaws of Death,

												    Into the mouth of Hell

												    Rode the six hundred.
												  æ
												  Flash'd all their sabres bare,

												    Flash'd as they turn'd in air,

												    Sabring the gunners there,

												    Charging an army, while

												    All the world wonder'd:

												    Plunged in the battery-smoke

												    Right thro' the line they broke;

												    Cossack and Russian

												    Reel'd from the sabre stroke

												    Shatter'd and sunder'd.

												    Then they rode back, but not

												    Not the six hundred.
												  æ
												  Cannon to right of them,

												    Cannon to left of them,

												    They that had fought so well

												    Came thro' the jaws of Death

												    Back from the mouth of Hell,

												    All that was left of them,

												    Left of six hundred.
												  æ
												  When can their glory fade?

												    O the wild charge they made!

												    All the world wondered.

												    Honor the charge they made,

												    Honor the Light Brigade,

											    Noble six hundred.



War Poems

#######################################################

Chariots rumble and roll: horses whinny and neigh.

												    footmen at their girdle bows and arrows display.

												    Fathers, mothers, wives, and children by them go--

												    'Tis not the choking dust alone that strangles what they say!

												    Their clothes they clutch; their feet they stamp; their crush blocks up the way.

											      The sounds of weeping mount above the clouds that gloom the day.
												  æ
												  The passers-by inquire of them, "But whither do you go?"

												    They only say: "We're mustering--do not disturb us so."

												    These fifteen years and upwards, the Northern Pass defend;

												    And still at forty years of age their service does not end.

												    All young they left their villages--just registered were they--

												    The war they quitted sees again the same men worn and gray.

												    And all along the boundary their blood has made a sea.

												    But never till the World is his, will Wu Huang happy be!
												  æ
												  Have you not heard--in Shantung there two hundred districts lie.

												    All overgrown with briar and weed and wasted utterly?

												    The stouter women swing and hoe and guide the stubborn plough,

												    The fields have lost their boundaries--the corn grows wildly now.

												    And routed bands with hunger grim come down in disarray

												    To rob and rend and outrage them, and treat them as a prey.
												  æ
												  Although the leaders question them, the soldiers' plaints resound.

												    And winter has not stopped the war upon the western bound.

												    And war needs funds; the Magistrates for taxes press each day.

												    The land tax and the duties--Ah! how shall these be found?
												  æ
												  In times like this stout sons to bear is sorrow and dismay.

												    Far better girls--to marry, to a home not far away.

												    But sons!--are buried in the grass!--yon Tsaidam's waste survey!

												    The bones of those who fell before are bleaching on the plain.

												    Their spirits weep our ghosts to hear lamenting all their pain.

											    Beneath the gloomy sky there runs a wailing in the rain.



Religious Poems

#######################################################

The self-deceit of having wrought the light.
											    
												  PEOPLE arrive to worship in their church.
												  æ
												  Though it is getting tired and insecure,

												    The monument can make a gathering yet

												    With people poured into it by the roads.

												    It sifts them as they enter through its porch,

												    And gently it removes from each the thoughts

												    Which might not melt so well as all the rest,

												    Replacing them by others left behind

												    By those who came to Mass in days of old.
												  æ
												  The crowd which tramples on the flags outside

												    Bears nosegays of ideas new and bright;

												    The fresh dreams of to-day spread over them,

												    Rosy and blue as sunshades which in their

												    Own manner dye the radiance of the sky.
												  æ
												  Inside there are no nosegays and no sunshades.
												  æ
												  The naves and aisles are overflowing with

												    A crowd the pillars intimately know,

												    Their contact is as ancient as the church,

												    And every summer Sunday when the sun

												    Begins to lick the windows by one edge,

												    And in the winter of discoloured lamps,

												    For centuries this crowd has been reborn

												    On every following Sunday still the same.
												  æ
												  Women and men are entering in file.
												  æ
												  The crowd is borne in haste by all the doors,

												    Rumbling an instant, ordered, then appeased;

												    It has not changed its shape; it is already

												    Moulded unto the contours of the walls;

												    Faithfully bodies lean on the same chairs.

												    Now it is born again while ring the bells.
												  
												    But the dark power

												      That gives life

												      On the seventh day

												      Of every week,

												      Softens at last

												      Like an old spring,

												      Little by little

												      Born less far

												      From death.
												    æ
												    It is a group

												      Worn out with use

												      Whose flesh grows flabby.

												      And in the winter

												      It is cold

												      Under the roof.

												      In olden days,

												      In the city
											    
												  It was the greatest of unanimous beings,

												    And all the city was transfused in it.

												    But now the workshops have arisen,

												    The workshops full of youth!

												    They live in ardour.

												    Their smoke soars higher than the sound of bells.

												    They do not fear to hide the sun,

											      For their machines make sunshine.
												  æ
												  Like a dog that comes out of a pool and sneezes,

												    The workshop shivering scatters round it drops

												    Of energy that wake the town to life.
												  
												    But the senile group

												      Sprouts not with bristling

												      Wires and cables.

												      No electricity

												      Rustles from it

												      To countless houses.
												    æ
												    It is feeble,

												      Its chinks are stopped,

												      It is gathered in.
											    
												  But it preserves with pride its fixed idea:

												    Others may swell with sap and ramify;

												    And shadow with a foliage of green forces

												    All the massed houses;

												    The humble group would tenderly, heart to heart,

												    Speak to the infinite group benevolent words.

											      For it is sure a soul stands o'er the world.
												  æ
												  It knows God's finger painlessly from Heaven

												    Leads the leash of natural forces;

												    That God sees all, and that His tender eyes

												    Wrap up the form and penetrate the essence

												    Of things.

												    The group is sure of it.

												    But fears

												    Lest having to keep watch o'er all these minds

												    And bodies, all these angels, beasts, and deaths,

												    Ant-hills, cities, forests,

												    Planets and planetary systems,

												    God see no more the little auditory

												    Which listens to the Mass in pillared shade.
												  æ
												  It calls Him; makes to Him the holy signs.

												    In olden days God taught His creatures words

												    Which force Him to give heed and to vouchsafe.
												  æ
												  The group that mumbles them knows not their meaning,

												    But knows the priest before the altar knows:

												    The illuminated summit of the group.
												  æ
												  Upon the murmurs serving it as rollers

												    Slowly the common thought advances, like

												    A boat that fishers launch into the sea;

												    And onward floats the thought of God.
												  æ
												  From hearts the fervour passes to the walls,

												    The rising fluid magnetizes

												    The steeple, and the steeple brings down God.
												  
												    God approaches, God descends;

												      He is quite near; the air

												      Weighs heavier.
												    æ
												    Something compresses, heats it;

												      The choir is filled with incense

												      So that, arriving, God

												      Shall find here clouds

												      Like those He dwells in,

												      And feel less strange.
											    
												  He is quite near, quite near. You can whisper to Him,

												    Tell Him what you would dare tell no man, ask Him

												    For anything you like. And even if God

											      Refuse, He is so good you cannot vex Him.
												  æ
												  "O God in Heaven, vouchsafe to cure my leg!

												    Matter burst from it yesterday.--My God,

												    Vouchsafe to fill my shop with customers!

												    --Help me to find out if my servant John

												    Is robbing me!--O God, cure my sore eyes!

												    --Save me, my God, from getting drunk so often!

												    --Lord, let my son pass his examination!

												    He is so shy. Thou shalt have a great big candle.

												    --Help me to make her fall in love with me,

												    I will put ninepence in St. Anthony's box.

												    --My God! if only I could get some work!

												    --He makes a martyr of me. Let him die!

												    --My God, my God, I am certain I am pregnant;

												    O let the child go rotten in my belly."
												  æ
												  It is like a hamlet at the hour of noon.

												    On every soul's hearth they have kindled fire,

												    Which casts its smoke and yields it to the wind.

												    God sees the bluish prayers climb up to Him.
												  æ
												  They are a perfume which delight Him. He

												    Comes nearer. The crowd rises, touches Him.

												    Their longing to caress serves them for arm.

												    They seize on God to press Him close to them;

												    To be alone and to possess Him all.
												  æ
												  This morning, God, the conscience of the universe,

												    Has from the universe withdrawn, like blood

												    Out of a bull's limbs bleeding at the head.

												    All the world's soul, the whole of God is here;

												    The church is the glad vase that gathers Him.
												  æ
												  God now can think but of the little crowd;

												    The things they wish He too must wish, since He

												    In them is incarnated and their breath.
												  
												    Then in the mystical certitude;

												      Drunk with alcohol

												      Hid in the organ notes,

												      The light of the rose-window,

												      And the stained glass;

												      Clad with incense like

												      A scented sleep that bends and swoons;

												      By old, magnetic rites

												      Plunged in hypnotic sleep

												      Whence mount, like bubbles

												      Crossing stagnant waters,

												      Memories and mouldiness

												      And age-old madness;

												      Forgetting that beyond these walls

												      There is the town, and earth,

												      And then infinity;

												      The group so old, so little,

												      Which withers, which is scarce alive,

												      Dreams aloud that it is God.

In the streets of Constance was heard the shout,

"Masters! bring the arch-heretic out!"

												    The stake had been planted, the faggots spread,

												    And the tongues of the torches flickered red.

"Hus to the flames!" they fiercely cried:

											      Then the gate of the Convent opened wide.
												  æ
												  Into the sun from the dark he came,

												    His face as fixed as a face in a frame.

												    His arms were pinioned, but you could see,

												    By the smile round his mouth, that his soul was free;

												    And his eye with a strange bright glow was lit,

												    Like a star just before the dawn quencheth it.
												  æ
												  To the pyre the crowd a pathway made,

												    And he walked along it with no man's aid;

												    Steadily on to the place he trod,

												    Commending aloud his soul to God.

												    Aloud he prayed, though they mocked his prayer:

												    He was the only thing tranquil there.
												  æ
												  But, seeing the faggots, he quickened pace,

												    As we do when we see the loved one's face.

												    "Now, now, let the torch in the resin flare,

												    Till my books and body be ashes and air!

												    But the spirit of both shall return to men,

												    As dew that rises descends again."
												  æ
												  From the back of the crowd where the women wept,

												    And the children whispered, a peasant stepped.

												    A goodly faggot was on his back,

												    Brittle and sere, from last year's stack;

												    And he placed it carefully where the torch

												    Was sure to lick and the flame to scorch.
												  æ
												  "Why bring you fresh fuel, friend? Here are sticks

												    To burn up a score of heretics."

												    Answered the peasant, "Because this year,

												    My hearth will be cold, for is firewood dear;

												    And Heaven be witness I pay my toll,

												    And burn your body to save my soul."
												  æ
												  Huss gazed at the peasant, he gazed at the pile,

												    Then over his features there stole a smile.

												    "O Sancta Simplicitas! By God's troth,

												    This faggot of yours may save us both,

												    And He who judgeth perchance prefer

												    To the victim the executioner!"
												  æ
												  Then unto the stake was he tightly tied,

												    And the torches were lowered and thrust inside.

												    You could hear the twigs crackle and sputter the flesh,

												    Then "Sancta Simplicitus!" moaned afresh.

												    'Twas the last men heard of the words he spoke,

											    Ere to Heaven his soul went up with the smoke.

I
											    
												  												    Banner of England, not for a season, O banner of Britain, hast thou

												    Floated in conquering battle or flapt to the battle-cry!

												    Never with mightier glory than when we had rearäó»d thee on high

												    Flying at top of the roofs in the ghastly siege of Lucknowäóî

												    Shot throäó» the staff or the halyard, but ever we raised thee anew,

												  												    Frail were the works that defended the hold that we held with our livesäóî

												    Women and children among us, God help them, our children and wives!

												    Hold it we mightäóîand for fifteen days or for twenty at most.

												    äóÖNever surrender, I charge you, but every man die at his post!äó»

												    Voice of the dead whom we loved, our Lawrence the best of the brave:

												    Cold were his brows when we kissäó»d himäóîwe laid him that night in his grave.

												    äóÖEvery man die at his post!äó» and there hailäó»d on our houses and halls

												    Death from their rifle-bullets, and death from their cannon-balls,

												    Death in our innermost chamber, and death at our slight barricade,

												    Death while we stood with the musket, and death while we stoopt to the spade,

												    Death to the dying, and wounds to the wounded, for often there fell,

												    Striking the hospital wall, crashing throäó» it, their shot and their shell,

												    Deathäóîfor their spies were among us, their marksmen were told of our best,

												    So that the brute bullet broke throäó» the brain that could think for the rest;

												    Bullets would sing by our foreheads, and bullets would rain at our feetäóî

												    Fire from ten thousand at once of the rebels that girdled us roundäóî

												    Death at the glimpse of a finger from over the breadth of a street,

												    Death from the heights of the mosque and the palace, and death in the ground!

												    Mine? yes, a mine! Countermine! down, down! and creep throäó» the hole!

												    Keep the revolver in hand! you can hear himäóîthe murderous mole!

												    Quiet, ah! quietäóîwait till the point of the pickaxe be throäó»!

											      												    Ay, but the foe sprung his mine many times, and it chanced on a day

												    Soon as the blast of that underground thunderclap echo äóÖd away,

												    Dark throäó» the smoke and the sulphur like so many fiends in their helläóî

												    Cannon-shot, musket-shot, volley on volley, and yell upon yelläóî

												    Fiercely on all the defences our myriad enemy fell.

												    What have they done? where is it? Out yonder. Guard the Redan!

												    Storm at the Water-gate! storm at the Bailey-gate! storm, and it ran

												    Surging and swaying all round us, as ocean on every side

												    Plunges and heaves at a bank that is daily devouräó»d by the tideäóî

												    So many thousands that if they be bold enough, who shall escape?

												    Kill or be killäó»d, live or die, they shall know we are soldiers and men

												    Ready! take aim at their leadersäóîtheir masses are gappäó»d with our grapeäóî

												    Backward they reel like the wave, like the wave flinging forward again,

											        Each of us fought as if hope for the garrison hung but on him;

											        Stilläóîcould we watch at all points? we were every day fewer and fewer.

											        There was a whisper among us, but only a whisper that past

									                Stench of old offal decaying, and infinite torment of flies.

									                Thoughts of the breezes of May blowing over an English field,

Santa Anna came storming, as a storm might come;

												    There was rumble of cannon; there was rattle of blade;

												    There was cavalry, infantry, bugle and drum--

												    Full seven proud thousand in pomp and parade,

												    The chivalry, flower of all Mexico;

											      And a gaunt two hundred in the Alamo!
												  æ
												  And thirty lay sick, and some were shot through;

												    For the siege had been bitter, and bloody and long.

												    "Surrender or die!"--"Men, what will you do?"

												    And Travis, great Travis, drew sword, quick and strong;

												    Drew a line at his feet ... Will you come? Will you go?

												    I die with my wounded, in the Alamo."
												  æ
												  Then Bowie gasped, "Guide me over that line!"

												    Then Crockett, one hand to the stick, one hand to his gun,

												    Crossed with him; then never a word or a sign,

												    Till all, sick or well, all, all save but one,

												    One man. Then a woman stopped praying and slow

												    Across, to die with the heroes of the Alamo.
												  æ
												  Then that one coward fled, in the night, in that night

												    When all men silently prayed and thought

												    Of home; of tomorrow; of God and the right,

												    Till dawn; then Travis sent his single last cannon-shot,

												    In answer to insolent Mexico,

												    From the old bell-tower of the Alamo.
												  æ
												  Then came Santa Anna; a crescent of flame!

												    Then the red escalade; then the fight hand to hand;

												    Such an unequal fight as never had name

												    Since the Persian hordes butchered that doomed Spartan band.

												    All day--all day and all night, and the morning, so slow,

												    Through the battle smoke mantling the Alamo.
												  æ
												  Then silence! Such silence! Two thousand lay dead

												    In a crescent outside! And within? Not a breath

												    Save the gasp of a woman, with gory, gashed head,

												    All alone, with her dead there, waiting for death;

												    And she but a nurse. Yet when shall we know

												    Another like this of the Alamo?
												  æ
												  Shout "Victory, victory, victory ho!"

												    I say, 'tis not always with the hosts that win:

												    I say that the victory, high or low,

												    Is given the hero who grapples with sin,

												    Or legion or single; just asking to know

											    When duty fronts death in his Alamo.

#######################################################

Cross-ribboned shoes; a muslin gown,

												    High-waisted, girdled with bright blue;

												    A straw poke bonnet which hid the frown

												    She pluckered her little brows into

												    As she picked her dainty passage through

												    The dusty street.  "Ah, Mademoiselle,

												    A dirty pathway, we need rain,

												    My poor fruits suffer, and the shell

												    Of this nut's too big for its kernel, lain

												    Here in the sun it has shrunk again.

												    The baker down at the corner says

												    We need a battle to shake the clouds;

												    But I am a man of peace, my ways

												    Don't look to the killing of men in crowds.

												    Poor fellows with guns and bayonets for shrouds!

												    Pray, Mademoiselle, come out of the sun.

												    Let me dust off that wicker chair.  It's cool

												    In here, for the green leaves I have run

												    In a curtain over the door, make a pool

												    Of shade.  You see the pears on that stool --

												    The shadow keeps them plump and fair."

												    Over the fruiterer's door, the leaves

												    Held back the sun, a greenish flare

												    Quivered and sparked the shop, the sheaves

												    Of sunbeams, glanced from the sign on the eaves,

												    Shot from the golden letters, broke

												    And splintered to little scattered lights.

												    Jeanne Tourmont entered the shop, her poke

												    Bonnet tilted itself to rights,

												    And her face looked out like the moon on nights

												    Of flickering clouds.  "Monsieur Popain, I

												    Want gooseberries, an apple or two,

												    Or excellent plums, but not if they're high;

												    Haven't you some which a strong wind blew?

												    I've only a couple of francs for you."

												    Monsieur Popain shrugged and rubbed his hands.

												    What could he do, the times were sad.

												    A couple of francs and such demands!

												    And asking for fruits a little bad.

												    Wind-blown indeed!  He never had

												    Anything else than the very best.

												    He pointed to baskets of blunted pears

												    With the thin skin tight like a bursting vest,

												    All yellow, and red, and brown, in smears.

												    Monsieur Popain's voice denoted tears.

												    He took up a pear with tender care,

												    And pressed it with his hardened thumb.

"Smell it, Mademoiselle, the perfume there

												    Is like lavender, and sweet thoughts come

												    Only from having a dish at home.

												    And those grapes!  They melt in the mouth like wine,

												    Just a click of the tongue, and they burst to honey.

												    They're only this morning off the vine,

												    And I paid for them down in silver money.

												    The Corporal's widow is witness, her pony

												    Brought them in at sunrise to-day.

												    Those oranges -- Gold!  They're almost red.

												    They seem little chips just broken away

												    From the sun itself.  Or perhaps instead

												    You'd like a pomegranate, they're rarely gay,

												    When you split them the seeds are like crimson spray.

												    Yes, they're high, they're high, and those Turkey figs,

												    They all come from the South, and Nelson's ships

												    Make it a little hard for our rigs.

												    They must be forever giving the slips

												    To the cursed English, and when men clips

												    Through powder to bring them, why dainties mounts

												    A bit in price.  Those almonds now,

												    I'll strip off that husk, when one discounts

												    A life or two in a nigger row

												    With the man who grew them, it does seem how

												    They would come dear; and then the fight

												    At sea perhaps, our boats have heels

												    And mostly they sail along at night,

												    But once in a way they're caught; one feels

												    Ivory's not better nor finer -- why peels

												    From an almond kernel are worth two sous.

												    It's hard to sell them now," he sighed.

"Purses are tight, but I shall not lose.

There's plenty of cheaper things to choose."

												    He picked some currants out of a wide

												    Earthen bowl.  "They make the tongue

												    Almost fly out to suck them, bride

												    Currants they are, they were planted long

												    Ago for some new Marquise, among

												    Other great beauties, before the Chateau

												    Was left to rot.  Now the Gardener's wife,

												    He that marched off to his death at Marengo,

												    Sells them to me; she keeps her life

												    From snuffing out, with her pruning knife.

												    She's a poor old thing, but she learnt the trade

												    When her man was young, and the young Marquis

												    Couldn't have enough garden.  The flowers he made

												    All new!  And the fruits!  But 'twas said that he

												    Was no friend to the people, and so they laid

												    Some charge against him, a cavalcade

												    Of citizens took him away; they meant

												    Well, but I think there was some mistake.

												    He just pottered round in his garden, bent

												    On growing things; we were so awake

												    In those days for the New Republic's sake.

												    He's gone, and the garden is all that's left

												    Not in ruin, but the currants and apricots,

												    And peaches, furred and sweet, with a cleft

												    Full of morning dew, in those green-glazed pots,

												    Why, Mademoiselle, there is never an eft

												    Or worm among them, and as for theft,

												    How the old woman keeps them I cannot say,

												    But they're finer than any grown this way."

												    Jeanne Tourmont drew back the filigree ring

												    Of her striped silk purse, tipped it upside down

												    And shook it, two coins fell with a ding

												    Of striking silver, beneath her gown

												    One rolled, the other lay, a thing

												    Sparked white and sharply glistening,

												    In a drop of sunlight between two shades.

												    She jerked the purse, took its empty ends

												    And crumpled them toward the centre braids.

												    The whole collapsed to a mass of blends

												    Of colours and stripes.  "Monsieur Popain, friends

												    We have always been.  In the days before

												    The Great Revolution my aunt was kind

												    When you needed help.  You need no more;

												    'Tis we now who must beg at your door,

												    And will you refuse?"  The little man

												    Bustled, denied, his heart was good,

												    But times were hard.  He went to a pan

												    And poured upon the counter a flood

												    Of pungent raspberries, tanged like wood.

												    He took a melon with rough green rind

												    And rubbed it well with his apron tip.

												    Then he hunted over the shop to find

												    Some walnuts cracking at the lip,

												    And added to these a barberry slip

												    Whose acrid, oval berries hung

												    Like fringe and trembled.  He reached a round

												    Basket, with handles, from where it swung

												    Against the wall, laid it on the ground

												    And filled it, then he searched and found

												    The francs Jeanne Tourmont had let fall.

"You'll return the basket, Mademoiselle?"

She smiled, "The next time that I call,

Monsieur.  You know that very well."

												    'Twas lightly said, but meant to tell.

												    Monsieur Popain bowed, somewhat abashed.

												    She took her basket and stepped out.

												    The sunlight was so bright it flashed

												    Her eyes to blindness, and the rout

												    Of the little street was all about.

												    Through glare and noise she stumbled, dazed.

												    The heavy basket was a care.

												    She heard a shout and almost grazed

												    The panels of a chaise and pair.

												    The postboy yelled, and an amazed

												    Face from the carriage window gazed.

												    She jumped back just in time, her heart

												    Beating with fear.  Through whirling light

												    The chaise departed, but her smart

												    Was keen and bitter.  In the white

												    Dust of the street she saw a bright

												    Streak of colours, wet and gay,

												    Red like blood.  Crushed but fair,

												    Her fruit stained the cobbles of the way.

												    Monsieur Popain joined her there.

"Tiens, Mademoiselle,

c'est le General Bonaparte, partant pour la Guerre!"



Death Poems

#######################################################

When I am dead

												    Lay me not straitly on a lidded bed,

												    A dark cell, satin walled--

												    (Satin has always set my nerves on edge.)

												    Heap me not with the heavy-scented pledge

												    Of pallid lilies, freesia's waxy bloom--

												    Narcissus (Always in a room

											    Their breath has sickened me.)
												  æ
												  Let not my friends be called

												    (And others who have never been my friends)

												    To crowd, uneasy, in a close, hushed gloom

												    Of shutters which outprison sun and breezes

												    While in the corner where he has been shoved,

												    Suave and black gloved

												    And glad,

												    The undertaker servilely attends,

												    And one I hardly knew

												    Pays tribute to the things I did not do,

												    Chants comfort with a solemn-voiced appeal,

												    For grief, he says, that no one ought to feel.

												    For restlessly, I'll tickle a child's nose until he sneezes

												    And if the music's strain be slow and drear

												    I'll break the wailing voice of one who sings,

												    And snap maliciously the viol's strings.

												    Low in the ear

												    Of one who was most near

												    I'll whisper whimsies not to be withstood,

												    Till a shrill giggle, sending tension slack,

												    Pulls it so swiftly taut it waits to crack.

												    Those who have loved me not

												    I'll smile to hear,

												    In a dry agony,

												    Strangely embarrassed, praying for a tear;

												    But the red eyes of those whom I hold dear

											    Shall shame themselves--and me.
												  æ
								                Rattle me not, a grim procession's head,

												    On rough roads to the still, green covered plot

												    Where the dead

												    Lie and rot.

												    When I am dead

												    Give me the kind, swift flames to set me free,

												    And in the empty room I leave behind,

												    In the spilled sun set roses red,

												    And let a lazy wind

												    Drift the light curtains gladly

												    To and fro.
								                æ
											    Though,

												    If I should be elected

												    To be dissected,

												    I should be interested and proud.

												    Oh! anything is better than monuments erected

												    To a shroud.



Historical Poems

#######################################################

I
											         Frindsbury, Kent, 1786
											    
												  Bang!

												    Bang!

												    Tap!

												    Tap-a-tap!  Rap!

												    All through the lead and silver Winter days,

												    All through the copper of Autumn hazes.

												    Tap to the red rising sun,

												    Tap to the purple setting sun.

												    Four years pass before the job is done.

												    Two thousand oak trees grown and felled,

												    Two thousand oaks from the hedgerows of the Weald,

												    Sussex had yielded two thousand oaks

												    With huge boles

												    Round which the tape rolls

												    Thirty mortal feet, say the village folks.

												    Two hundred loads of elm and Scottish fir;

												    Planking from Dantzig.

												    My!  What timber goes into a ship!

												    Tap!  Tap!

												    Two years they have seasoned her ribs on the ways,

												    Tapping, tapping.

												    You can hear, though there's nothing where you gaze.

												    Through the fog down the reaches of the river,

												    The tapping goes on like heart-beats in a fever.

												    The church-bells chime

												    Hours and hours,

												    Dropping days in showers.

												    Bang!  Rap!  Tap!

												    Go the hammers all the time.

												    They have planked up her timbers

												    And the nails are driven to the head;

												    They have decked her over,

												    And again, and again.

												    The shoring-up beams shudder at the strain.

												    Black and blue breeches,

												    Pigtails bound and shining:

												    Like ants crawling about,

												    The hull swarms with carpenters, running in and out.

												    Joiners, calkers,

												    And they are all terrible talkers.

												    Jem Wilson has been to sea and he tells some wonderful tales

												    Of whales, and spice islands,

												    And pirates off the Barbary coast.

												    He boasts magnificently, with his mouth full of nails.

												    Stephen Pibold has a tenor voice,

												    He shifts his quid of tobacco and sings:

  ææ"The second in command was blear-eyed Ned:

												    ææææWhile the surgeon his limb was a-lopping,

												    ææA nine-pounder came and smack went his head,

												    ææææPull away, pull away, pull away!  I say;

												    ææææRare news for my Meg of Wapping!"

												    Every Sunday

												    People come in crowds

												    (After church-time, of course)

												    In curricles, and gigs, and wagons,

												    And some have brought cold chicken and flagons

												    Of wine,

												    And beer in stoppered jugs.

  "Dear!  Dear!  But I tell 'ee 'twill be a fine ship.

												    There's none finer in any of the slips at Chatham."
												  æ
												  The third Summer's roses have started in to blow,

												    When the fine stern carving is begun.

												    Flutings, and twinings, and long slow swirls,

												    Bits of deal shaved away to thin spiral curls.

												    Tap!  Tap!  A cornucopia is nailed into place.

												    Rap-a-tap!  They are putting up a railing filigreed like Irish lace.

												    The Three Town's people never saw such grace.

												    And the paint on it!  The richest gold leaf!

												    Why, the glitter when the sun is shining passes belief.

												    And that row of glass windows tipped toward the sky

												    Are rubies and carbuncles when the day is dry.

												    Oh, my!  Oh, my!

												    They have coppered up the bottom,

												    And the copper nails

												    Stand about and sparkle in big wooden pails.

												    Bang!  Clash!  Bang!

  ææ"And he swigg'd, and Nick swigg'd,

												    ææææAnd Ben swigg'd, and Dick swigg'd,

												    ææAnd I swigg'd, and all of us swigg'd it,

												    ææææAnd swore there was nothing like grog."

												    It seems they sing,

												    Even though coppering is not an easy thing.

												    What a splendid specimen of humanity is a true British workman,

												    Say the people of the Three Towns,

												    As they walk about the dockyard

												    To the sound of the evening church-bells.

												    And so artistic, too, each one tells his neighbour.

												    What immense taste and labour!

												    Miss Jessie Prime, in a pink silk bonnet,

												    Titters with delight as her eyes fall upon it,

												    When she steps lightly down from Lawyer Green's whisky;

												    Such amazing beauty makes one feel frisky,

												    She explains.

												    Mr. Nichols says he is delighted

												    (He is the firm);

												    His work is all requited

												    If Miss Jessie can approve.

												    Miss Jessie answers that the ship is "a love".

												    The sides are yellow as marigold,

												    The port-lids are red when the ports are up:

												    Blood-red squares like an even chequer

												    Of yellow asters and portulaca.

												    There is a wide "black strake" at the waterline

												    And above is a blue like the sky when the weather is fine.

												    The inner bulwarks are painted red.

  "Why?" asks Miss Jessie.  "'Tis a horrid note."

												    Mr. Nichols clears his throat,

												    And tells her the launching day is set.

												    He says, "Be careful, the paint is wet."

												    But Miss Jessie has touched it, her sprigged muslin gown

												    Has a blood-red streak from the shoulder down.

  "It looks like blood," says Miss Jessie with a frown.
												  æ
												  Tap!  Tap!  Rap!

												    An October day, with waves running in blue-white lines and a capful of wind.

												    Three broad flags ripple out behind

												    Where the masts will be:

												    Royal Standard at the main,

												    Admiralty flag at the fore,

												    Union Jack at the mizzen.

												    The hammers tap harder, faster,

												    They must finish by noon.

												    The last nail is driven.

												    But the wind has increased to half a gale,

												    And the ship shakes and quivers upon the ways.

												    The Commissioner of Chatham Dockyard is coming

												    In his ten-oared barge from the King's Stairs;

												    The Marine's band will play "God Save Great George Our King";

												    And there is to be a dinner afterwards at the Crown, with speeches.

												    The wind screeches, and flaps the flags till they pound like hammers.

												    The wind hums over the ship,

												    And slips round the dog-shores,

												    Jostling them almost to falling.

												    There is no time now to wait for Commissioners and marine bands.

												    Mr. Nichols has a bottle of port in his hands.

												    He leans over, holding his hat, and shouts to the men below:

												    "Let her go!"

												    Bang!  Bang!  Pound!

												    The dog-shores fall to the ground,

												    And the ship slides down the greased planking.

												    A splintering of glass,

												    And port wine running all over the white and copper stem timbers.

												    "Success to his Majesty's ship, the Bellerophon!"

												    And the red wine washes away in the waters of the Medway.

											      
												  
												     II
											         Paris, March, 1814
											    
												  Fine yellow sunlight down the rue du Mont Thabor.

												    Ten o'clock striking from all the clock-towers of Paris.

												    Over the door of a shop, in gilt letters:

												    "Martin -- Parfumeur", and something more.

												    A large gilded wooden something.

												    Listen!  What a ringing of hammers!

												    Tap!

												    Tap!

												    Squeak!

												    Tap!  Squeak!  Tap-a-tap!

												    "Blaise."

												    "Oui, M'sieu."

												    "Don't touch the letters.  My name stays."

												    "Bien, M'sieu."

												    "Just take down the eagle, and the shield with the bees."

												    "As M'sieu pleases."

												    Tap!  Squeak!  Tap!

												    The man on the ladder hammers steadily for a minute or two,

												    Then stops.

												    "He!  Patron!

												    They are fastened well, Nom d'un Chien!

												    What if I break them?"

												    "Break away,

												    You and Paul must have them down to-day."

												    "Bien."

												    And the hammers start again,

												    Drum-beating at the something of gilded wood.

												    Sunshine in a golden flood

												    Lighting up the yellow fronts of houses,

												    Glittering each window to a flash.

												    Squeak!  Squeak!  Tap!

												    The hammers beat and rap.

												    A Prussian hussar on a grey horse goes by at a dash.

												    From other shops, the noise of striking blows:

												    Pounds, thumps, and whacks;

												    Wooden sounds:  splinters -- cracks.

												    Paris is full of the galloping of horses and the knocking of hammers.

												    "Hullo! Friend Martin, is business slack

												    That you are in the street this morning?  Don't turn your back

												    And scuttle into your shop like a rabbit to its hole.

												    I've just been taking a stroll.

												    The stinking Cossacks are bivouacked all up and down the Champs Elysees.

												    I can't get the smell of them out of my nostrils.

												    Dirty fellows, who don't believe in frills

												    Like washing.  Ah, mon vieux, you'd have to go

												    Out of business if you lived in Russia.  So!

												    We've given up being perfumers to the Emperor, have we?

												    Blaise,

												    Be careful of the hen,

												    Maybe I can find a use for her one of these days.

												    That eagle's rather well cut, Martin.

												    But I'm sick of smelling Cossack,

												    Take me inside and let me put my head into a stack

												    Of orris-root and musk."

												    Within the shop, the light is dimmed to a pearl-and-green dusk

												    Out of which dreamily sparkle counters and shelves of glass,

												    Containing phials, and bowls, and jars, and dishes; a mass

												    Of aqueous transparence made solid by threads of gold.

												    Gold and glass,

												    And scents which whiff across the green twilight and pass.

												    The perfumer sits down and shakes his head:

												    "Always the same, Monsieur Antoine,

												    You artists are wonderful folk indeed."

												    But Antoine Vernet does not heed.

												    He is reading the names on the bottles and bowls,

												    Done in fine gilt letters with wonderful scrolls.

												    "What have we here?  `Eau Imperial Odontalgique.'

												    I must say, mon cher, your names are chic.

												    But it won't do, positively it will not do.

												    Elba doesn't count.  Ah, here is another:

												    `Baume du Commandeur'.  That's better.  He needs something to smother

												    Regrets.  A little lubricant, too,

												    Might be useful.  I have it,

												    `Sage Oil', perhaps he'll be good now; with it we'll submit

												    This fine German rouge.  I fear he is pale."

												    "Monsieur Antoine, don't rail

												    At misfortune.  He treated me well and fairly."

												    "And you prefer him to Bourbons, admit it squarely."

												    "Heaven forbid!"  Bang!  Whack!

												    Squeak!  Squeak!  Crack!

												    CRASH!

												    "Oh, Lord, Martin!  That shield is hash.

												    The whole street is covered with golden bees.

												    They look like so many yellow peas,

												    Lying there in the mud.  I'd like to paint it.

												    `Plum pudding of Empire'.  That's rather quaint, it

												    Might take with the Kings.  Shall I try?"  "Oh, Sir,

												    You distress me, you do."  "Poor old Martin's purr!

												    But he hasn't a scratch in him, I know.

												    Now let us get back to the powders and patches.

												    Foolish man,

												    The Kings are here now.  We must hit on a plan

												    To change all these titles as fast as we can.

												    `Bouquet Imperatrice'.  Tut!  Tut!  Give me some ink --

												    `Bouquet de la Reine', what do you think?

												    Not the same receipt?

												    Now, Martin, put away your conceit.

												    Who will ever know?

												    `Extract of Nobility' -- excellent, since most of them are killed."

												    "But, Monsieur Antoine --"

												    "You are self-willed,

												    Martin.  You need a salve

												    For your conscience, do you?

												    Very well, we'll halve

												    The compliments, also the pastes and dentifrices;

												    Send some to the Kings, and some to the Empresses.

												    `Oil of Bitter Almonds' -- the Empress Josephine can have that.

												    `Oil of Parma Violets' fits the other one pat."

												    Rap!  Rap!  Bang!

												    "What a hideous clatter!

												    Blaise seems determined to batter

												    That poor old turkey into bits,

												    And pound to jelly my excellent wits.

												    Come, come, Martin, you mustn't shirk.

												    `The night cometh soon' -- etc.  Don't jerk

												    Me up like that.  `Essence de la Valliere' --

												    That has a charmingly Bourbon air.

												    And, oh! Magnificent!  Listen to this! --

												    `Vinaigre des Quatre Voleurs'.  Nothing amiss

												    With that -- England, Austria, Russia and Prussia!

												    Martin, you're a wonder,

												    Upheavals of continents can't keep you under."

												    "Monsieur Antoine, I am grieved indeed

												    At such levity.  What France has gone through --"

												    "Very true, Martin, very true,

												    But never forget that a man must feed."

												    Pound!  Pound!  Thump!

												    Pound!

												    "Look here, in another minute Blaise will drop that bird on the ground."

												    Martin shrugs his shoulders.  "Ah, well, what then? --"

												    Antoine, with a laugh:  "I'll give you two sous for that antiquated hen."

												    The Imperial Eagle sells for two sous,

												    And the lilies go up.

												    ææææA man must choose!

											      
												  
												     III
											         Paris, April, 1814
											    
												  Cold, impassive, the marble arch of the Place du Carrousel.

												    Haughty, contemptuous, the marble arch of the Place du Carrousel.

												    Like a woman raped by force, rising above her fate,

												    Borne up by the cold rigidity of hate,

												    Stands the marble arch of the Place du Carrousel.

												    Tap!  Clink-a-tink!

												    Tap!  Rap!  Chink!

												    What falls to the ground like a streak of flame?

												    Hush!  It is only a bit of bronze flashing in the sun.

												    What are all those soldiers?  Those are not the uniforms of France.

												    Alas!  No!  The uniforms of France, Great Imperial France, are done.

												    They will rot away in chests and hang to dusty tatters in barn lofts.

												    These are other armies.  And their name?

												    Hush, be still for shame;

												    Be still and imperturbable like the marble arch.

												    Another bright spark falls through the blue air.

												    Over the Place du Carrousel a wailing of despair.

												    Crowd your horses back upon the people, Uhlans and Hungarian Lancers,

												    They see too much.

												    Unfortunately, Gentlemen of the Invading Armies, what they do not see,

												    they hear.

												    Tap!  Clink-a-tink!

												    Tap!

												    Another sharp spear

												    Of brightness,

												    And a ringing of quick metal lightness

												    On hard stones.

												    Workmen are chipping off the names of Napoleon's victories

												    From the triumphal arch of the Place du Carrousel.
												  æ
												  Do they need so much force to quell the crowd?

												    An old Grenadier of the line groans aloud,

												    And each hammer tap points the sob of a woman.

												    Russia, Prussia, Austria, and the faded-white-lily Bourbon king

												    Think it well

												    To guard against tumult,

												    A mob is an undependable thing.

												    Ding!  Ding!

												    Vienna is scattered all over the Place du Carrousel

												    In glittering, bent, and twisted letters.

												    Your betters have clattered over Vienna before,

												    Officer of his Imperial Majesty our Father-in-Law!

												    Tink!  Tink!

												    A workman's chisel can strew you to the winds,

												    Munich.

												    Do they think

												    To pleasure Paris, used to the fall of cities,

												    By giving her a fall of letters!
												  æ
												  It is a month too late.

												    One month, and our lily-white Bourbon king

												    Has done a colossal thing;

												    He has curdled love,

												    And soured the desires of a people.

												    Still the letters fall,

												    The workmen creep up and down their ladders like lizards on a wall.

												    Tap!  Tap!  Tink!

												    Clink!  Clink!

												    "Oh, merciful God, they will not touch Austerlitz!

												    Strike me blind, my God, my eyes can never look on that.

												    I would give the other leg to save it, it took one.

												    Curse them!  Curse them!  Aim at his hat.

												    Give me the stone.  Why didn't you give it to me?

												    I would not have missed.  Curse him!

												    Curse all of them!  They have got the `A'!"

												    Ding!  Ding!

												    "I saw the Terror, but I never saw so horrible a thing as this.

												    `Vive l'Empereur!  Vive l'Empereur!'"

												    "Don't strike him, Fritz.

												    The mob will rise if you do.

												    Just run him out to the `quai',

												    That will get him out of the way.

												    They are almost through."

												    Clink!  Tink!  Ding!

												    Clear as the sudden ring

												    Of a bell

												    "Z" strikes the pavement.

												    Farewell, Austerlitz, Tilsit, Presbourg;

												    Farewell, greatness departed.

												    Farewell, Imperial honours, knocked broadcast by the beating hammers

												    of ignorant workmen.

												    Straight, in the Spring moonlight,

												    Rises the deflowered arch.

												    In the silence, shining bright,

												    She stands naked and unsubdued.

												    Her marble coldness will endure the march

												    Of decades.

												    Rend her bronzes, hammers;

												    Cast down her inscriptions.

												    She is unconquerable, austere,

												    Cold as the moon that swims above her

												    When the nights are clear.

												  "Whoa!  Victorine.

												    Devil take the mare!  I've never seen so vicious a beast.

												    She kicked Jules the last time she was here,

												    He's been lame ever since, poor chap."

												    Rap!  Tap!

												    Tap-a-tap-a-tap!  Tap!  Tap!

												    "I'd rather be lame than dead at Waterloo, M'sieu Charles."

												    "Sacre Bleu!  Don't mention Waterloo, and the damned grinning British.

												    We didn't run in the old days.

												    There wasn't any running at Jena.

												    Those were decent days,

												    And decent men, who stood up and fought.

												    We never got beaten, because we wouldn't be.

												    See!"

												    "You would have taught them, wouldn't you, Sergeant Boignet?

												    But to-day it's everyone for himself,

												    And the Emperor isn't what he was."

												    "How the Devil do you know that?

												    If he was beaten, the cause

												    Is the green geese in his army, led by traitors.

												    Oh, I say no names, Monsieur Charles,

												    You needn't hammer so loud.

												    If there are any spies lurking behind the bellows,

												    I beg they come out.  Dirty fellows!"

												    The old Sergeant seizes a red-hot poker

												    And advances, brandishing it, into the shadows.

												    The rows of horses flick

												    Placid tails.

												    Victorine gives a savage kick

												    As the nails

												    Go in.  Tap!  Tap!

												    Jules draws a horseshoe from the fire

												    And beats it from red to peacock-blue and black,

												    Purpling darker at each whack.

												    Ding!  Dang!  Dong!

												    Ding-a-ding-dong!

												    It is a long time since any one spoke.

												    Then the blacksmith brushes his hand over his eyes,

												    "Well," he sighs,

												    "He's broke."

												    The Sergeant charges out from behind the bellows.

												    "It's the green geese, I tell you,

												    Their hearts are all whites and yellows,

												    There's no red in them.  Red!

												    That's what we want.  Fouche should be fed

												    To the guillotine, and all Paris dance the carmagnole.

												    That would breed jolly fine lick-bloods

												    To lead his armies to victory."

												    "Ancient history, Sergeant.

												    He's done."

												    "Say that again, Monsieur Charles, and I'll stun

												    You where you stand for a dung-eating Royalist."

												    The Sergeant gives the poker a savage twist;

												    He is as purple as the cooling horseshoes.

												    The air from the bellows creaks through the flues.

												    Tap!  Tap!  The blacksmith shoes Victorine,

												    And through the doorway a fine sheen

												    Of leaves flutters, with the sun between.

												    By a spurt of fire from the forge

												    You can see the Sergeant, with swollen gorge,

												    Puffing, and gurgling, and choking;

												    The bellows keep on croaking.

												    They wheeze,

												    And sneeze,

												    Creak!  Bang!  Squeeze!

												    And the hammer strokes fall like buzzing bees

												    Or pattering rain,

												    Or faster than these,

												    Like the hum of a waterfall struck by a breeze.

												    Clank! from the bellows-chain pulled up and down.

												    Clank!

												    And sunshine twinkles on Victorine's flank,

												    Starting it to blue,

												    Dropping it to black.

												    Clack!  Clack!

												    Tap-a-tap!  Tap!

												    Lord!  What galloping!  Some mishap

												    Is making that man ride so furiously.

												    "Francois, you!

												    Victorine won't be through

												    For another quarter of an hour."  "As you hope to die,

												    Work faster, man, the order has come."

												    "What order?  Speak out.  Are you dumb?"

												    "A chaise, without arms on the panels, at the gate

												    In the far side-wall, and just to wait.

												    We must be there in half an hour with swift cattle.

												    You're a stupid fool if you don't hear that rattle.

												    Those are German guns.  Can't you guess the rest?

												    Nantes, Rochefort, possibly Brest."

												    Tap!  Tap! as though the hammers were mad.

												    Dang!  Ding!  Creak!  The farrier's lad

												    Jerks the bellows till he cracks their bones,

												    And the stifled air hiccoughs and groans.

												    The Sergeant is lying on the floor

												    Stone dead, and his hat with the tricolore

												    Cockade has rolled off into the cinders.  Victorine snorts and lays back

												    her ears.

												    What glistens on the anvil?  Sweat or tears?

											      
												  
												     V
											         St. Helena, May, 1821
											    
												  Tap!  Tap!  Tap!

												    Through the white tropic night.

												    Tap!  Tap!

												    Beat the hammers,

												    Unwearied, indefatigable.

												    They are hanging dull black cloth about the dead.

												    Lustreless black cloth

												    Which chokes the radiance of the moonlight

												    And puts out the little moving shadows of leaves.

												    Tap!  Tap!

												    The knocking makes the candles quaver,

												    And the long black hangings waver

												    Tap!  Tap!  Tap!

												    Tap!  Tap!

												    In the ears which do not heed.

												    Tap!  Tap!

												    Above the eyelids which do not flicker.

												    Tap!  Tap!

												    Over the hands which do not stir.

												    Chiselled like a cameo of white agate against the hangings,

												    Struck to brilliance by the falling moonlight,

												    A face!

												    Sharp as a frozen flame,

												    Beautiful as an altar lamp of silver,

												    And still.  Perfectly still.

												    In the next room, the men chatter

												    As they eat their midnight lunches.

												    A knife hits against a platter.

												    But the figure on the bed

												    Between the stifling black hangings

												    Is cold and motionless,

												    Played over by the moonlight from the windows

												    And the indistinct shadows of leaves.
												  æ
												  Tap!  Tap!

												    Upholsterer Darling has a fine shop in Jamestown.

												    Tap!  Tap!

												    Andrew Darling has ridden hard from Longwood to see to the work in his shop

												    in Jamestown.

												    He has a corps of men in it, toiling and swearing,

												    Knocking, and measuring, and planing, and squaring,

												    Working from a chart with figures,

												    Comparing with their rules,

												    Setting this and that part together with their tools.

												    Tap!  Tap!  Tap!

												    Haste indeed!

												    So great is the need

												    That carpenters have been taken from the new church,

												    Joiners have been called from shaping pews and lecterns

												    To work of greater urgency.

												    Coffins!

												    Coffins is what they are making this bright Summer morning.

												    Coffins -- and all to measurement.

												    There is a tin coffin,

												    A deal coffin,

												    A lead coffin,

												    And Captain Bennett's best mahogany dining-table

												    Has been sawed up for the grand outer coffin.

												    Tap!  Tap!  Tap!

												    Sunshine outside in the square,

												    But inside, only hollow coffins and the tapping upon them.

												    The men whistle,

												    And the coffins grow under their hammers

												    In the darkness of the shop.

												    Tap!  Tap!  Tap!
												  æ
												  Tramp of men.

												    Steady tramp of men.

												    Slit-eyed Chinese with long pigtails

												    Bearing oblong things upon their shoulders

												    March slowly along the road to Longwood.

												    Their feet fall softly in the dust of the road;

												    Sometimes they call gutturally to each other and stop to shift shoulders.

												    Four coffins for the little dead man,

												    Four fine coffins,

												    And one of them Captain Bennett's dining-table!

												    And sixteen splendid Chinamen, all strong and able

												    And of assured neutrality.

												    Ah!  George of England, Lord Bathhurst & Co.

												    Your princely munificence makes one's heart glow.

												    Huzza!  Huzza!  For the Lion of England!
												  æ
												  Tap!  Tap!  Tap!

												    Marble likeness of an Emperor,

												    Dead man, who burst your heart against a world too narrow,

												    The hammers drum you to your last throne

												    Which always you shall hold alone.

												    Tap!  Tap!

												    The glory of your past is faded as a sunset fire,

												    Your day lingers only like the tones of a wind-lyre

												    In a twilit room.

												    Here is the emptiness of your dream

												    Scattered about you.

												    Coins of yesterday,

												    Double napoleons stamped with Consul or Emperor,

												    Strange as those of Herculaneum --

												    And you just dead!

												    Not one spool of thread

												    Will these buy in any market-place.

												    Lay them over him,

												    They are the baubles of a crown of mist

												    Worn in a vision and melted away at waking.

												    Tap!  Tap!

												    His heart strained at kingdoms

												    And now it is content with a silver dish.

												    Strange World!  Strange Wayfarer!

												    Strange Destiny!

												    Lower it gently beside him and let it lie.

											    Tap!  Tap!  Tap!



Nature

#######################################################

Pray why are you so bare, so bare,
   Oh, bough of the old oak-tree;
And why, when I go through the shade you throw,
   Runs a shudder over me?

My leaves were green as the best, I trow,
   And sap ran free in my veins,
But I say in the moonlight dim and weird
   A guiltless victim's pains.

I bent me down to hear his sigh;
   I shook with his gurgling moan,
And I trembled sore when they rode away,
   And left him here alone.

They'd charged him with the old, old crime,
   And set him fast in jail:
Oh, why does the dog howl all night long,
   And why does the night wind wail?

He prayed his prayer and he swore his oath,
   And he raised his hand to the sky;
But the beat of hoofs smote on his ear,
   And the steady tread drew nigh.

Who is it rides by night, by night,
   Over the moonlit road?
And what is the spur that keeps the pace,
   What is the galling goad?

And now they beat at the prison door,
   "Ho, keeper, do not stay!
We are friends of him whom you hold within,
   And we fain would take him away

"From those who ride fast on our heels
   With mind to do him wrong;
They have no care for his innocence,
   And the rope they bear is long."

They have fooled the jailer with lying words,
   They have fooled the man with lies;
The bolts unbar, the locks are drawn,
   And the great door open flies.

Now they have taken him from the jail,
   And hard and fast they ride,
And the leader laughs low down in his throat,
   As they halt my trunk beside.

Oh, the judge, he wore a mask of black,
   And the doctor one of white,
And the minister, with his oldest son,
   Was curiously bedight.

Oh, foolish man, why weep you now?
   'Tis but a little space,
And the time will come when these shall dread
   The mem'ry of your face.

I feel the rope against my bark,
   And the weight of him in my grain,
I feel in the throe of his final woe
   The touch of my own last pain.

And never more shall leaves come forth
   On the bough that bears the ban;
I am burned with dread, I am dried and dead,
   From the curse of a guiltless man.

And ever the judge rides by, rides by,
   And goes to hunt the deer,
And ever another rides his soul
   In the guise of a mortal fear.

And ever the man he rides me hard,
   And never a night stays he;
For I feel his curse as a haunted bough,
   On the trunk of a haunted tree.



Death Poems

#######################################################

I am glad God saw Death

										        And gave Death a job taking care of all who are tired of living:
												  æ
												  When all the wheels in a clock are worn and slow and the connections loose

												    And the clock goes on ticking and telling the wrong time from hour to hour

												    And people around the house joke about what a bum clock it is,

												    How glad the clock is when the big Junk Man drives his wagon

												    Up to the house and puts his arms around the clock and says:

												    ææææ"You don't belong here,

												    ææææYou gotta come

												    ææææAlong with me,"

												    How glad the clock is then, when it feels the arms of the Junk Man close around it and carry it away.



Love

#######################################################

Let us go then, you and I,
When the evening is spread out against the sky
Like a patient etherized upon a table;
Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
The muttering retreats
Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
Streets that follow like a tedious argument
Of insidious intent
To lead you to an overwhelming question ...
Oh, do not ask, What is it?
Let us go and make our visit.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
And seeing that it was a soft October night,
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.

And indeed there will be time
For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,
Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;
There will be time, there will be time
To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;
There will be time to murder and create,
And time for all the works and days of hands
That lift and drop a question on your plate;
Time for you and time for me,
And time yet for a hundred indecisions,
And for a hundred visions and revisions,
Before the taking of a toast and tea.

In the room the women come and go
Talking of Michelangelo.

And indeed there will be time
To wonder, Do I dare? and, Do I dare?
Time to turn back and descend the stair,
With a bald spot in the middle of my hair 
(They will say: How his hair is growing thin!)
My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,
My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin 
(They will say: But how his arms and legs are thin!)
Do I dare
Disturb the universe?
In a minute there is time
For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.

For I have known them all already, known them all:
Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,
I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;
I know the voices dying with a dying fall
Beneath the music from a farther room.
               So how should I presume?

And I have known the eyes already, known them all
The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,
And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,
When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,
Then how should I begin
To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?
               And how should I presume?

And I have known the arms already, known them all
Arms that are braceleted and white and bare
(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!)
Is it perfume from a dress
That makes me so digress?
Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.
               And should I then presume?
               And how should I begin?

Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets
And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes
Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ...

I should have been a pair of ragged claws
Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.

And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!
Smoothed by long fingers,
Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,
Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.
Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,
Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?
But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,
Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,
I am no prophet  and heres no great matter;
I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,
And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,
And in short, I was afraid.

And would it have been worth it, after all,
After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,
Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,
Would it have been worth while,
To have bitten off the matter with a smile,
To have squeezed the universe into a ball
To roll it towards some overwhelming question,
To say: I am Lazarus, come from the dead,
Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all
If one, settling a pillow by her head
               Should say: That is not what I meant at all;
               That is not it, at all.

And would it have been worth it, after all,
Would it have been worth while,
After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,
After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor
And this, and so much more?
It is impossible to say just what I mean!
But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:
Would it have been worth while
If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl,
And turning toward the window, should say:
               That is not it at all,
               That is not what I meant, at all.

No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;
Am an attendant lord, one that will do
To swell a progress, start a scene or two,
Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,
Deferential, glad to be of use,
Politic, cautious, and meticulous;
Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;
At times, indeed, almost ridiculous
Almost, at times, the Fool.

I grow old ... I grow old ...
I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.

Shall I part my hair behind?   Do I dare to eat a peach?
I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.
I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.

I do not think that they will sing to me.

I have seen them riding seaward on the waves
Combing the white hair of the waves blown back
When the wind blows the water white and black.
We have lingered in the chambers of the sea
By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown
Till human voices wake us, and we drown.



Narrative Poems

#######################################################

I
											    
												  												    Hamelin town's in Brunswick,

												    By famous Hanover city;

												    The river Weser, deep and wide,

												    Washes its walls on either side;

												    A pleasanter spot you never spied;

												    But, when begins my ditty,

												    Almost five hundred years ago,

												    To see the townsfolk suffer so

												    From vermin, was a pity.
												  
												    II
											    
												  												    Rats! 

												    They fought the dogs and killed the cats,

												    And bit the babies in the cradles,

												    And ate the cheeses out of the vats,

												    And licked the soup from the cooks' own ladles, 

												    Split open the kegs of salted sprats. 

												    Made nests inside men's Sunday hats. 

												    And even spoiled the women's chats 

												    By drowning their speaking 

												    With shrieking and squeaking 

												    In fifty different sharps and flats. 
											    
												    III
											    
												  												    At last the people in a body 

												    To the Town Hall came flocking: 

"'Tis clear," cried they, "our Mayor's a noddy; 

And as for our Corporation, shocking 

To think we buy gowns lined with ermine 

For dolts that can't or won't determine 

What's best to rid us of our vermin! 

You hope, because you're old and obese, 

To find in the furry civic robe ease! 

Rouse up, sirs! give your brains a racking

To find the remedy we're lacking, 

Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing!"

At this the Mayor and Corporation 

Quaked with a mighty consternation. 
											    
												    IV
											    
												  												    An hour they sat in council;

												    At length the Mayor broke silence: 

"For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell, 

I wish I were a mile hence! 

It's easy to bid one rack one's brainäóî

I'm sure my poor head aches again,

I've scratched it so, and all in vain. 

Oh for a trap, a trap, a trap!"

Just as he said this, what should hap 

At the chamber door but a gentle tap? 

"Bless us," cried the Mayor, "what's that?" 

(With the Corporation as he sat, 

Looking little, though wondrous fat; 

Nor brighter was his eye, nor moister 

Than a too-long-opened oyster, 

Save when at noon his paunch grew mutinous

For a plate of turtle, green and glutinous) 

"Only a scraping of shoes on the mat? 

Anything like the sound of a rat 

Makes my heart go pit-a-pat!"
											    
												    V
											    
												  "Come in!"äóîthe Mayor cried, looking bigger:

												    And in did come the strangest figure! 

												    His queer long coat from heel to head 

												    Was half of yellow and half of red, 

												    And he himself was tall and thin, 

												    With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin, 

												    With light loose hair, yet swarthy skin, 

												    No tuft on cheek, nor beard on chin, 

												    But lips where smiles went out and in; 

												    There was no guessing his kith and kin: 

												    And nobody could enough admire 

												    The tall man and his quaint attire. 

												    Quoth one: "It's as my great grandsire, 

												    Starting up at the Trump of Doom's tone, 

												    Had walked his way from his painted tombstone!"
											    
												    VI
											    
												  												    He advanced to the council-table:

												    And, "Please your honors," said he, "I'm able,

												    By means of a secret charm, to draw

												    All creatures living beneath the sun,

												    That creep or swim or fly or run,

												    After me so as you never saw! 

												    And I chiefly use my charm

												    On creatures that do people harm, 

												    The mole and toad and newt and viper; 

												    And people call me the Pied Piper."

												    (And here they noticed round his neck 

												    A scarf of red and yellow stripe, 

												    To match with his coat of self-same cheque: 

												    And at the scarf's end hung a pipe; 

												    And his fingers, they noticed, were ever straying, 

												    As if impatient to be playing 

												    Upon this pipe, as low it dangled 

												    Over his vesture so old-fangled.) 

"Yet," said he, "poor piper as I am, 

In Tartary I freed the Cham,

Last June, from his huge swarms of gnats; 

I eased in Asia the Nizam 

Of a monstrous brood of vampire-bats: 

And as for what your brain bewilders,

If I can rid your town of rats 

Will you give me a thousand guilders?"

"One? fifty thousand!"äóîwas the exclamation 

Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation.
											    
												    VII
											    
												  												    Into the street the Piper stept, 

												    Smiling first a little smile, 

												    As if he knew what magic slept 

												    In his quiet pipe the while: 

												    Then, like a musical adept, 

												    To blow the pipe his lips he wrinkled, 

												    And green and blue his sharp eyes twinkled, 

												    Like a candle-flame where salt is sprinkled; 

												    And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered, 

												    You heard as if an army muttered: 

												    And the muttering grew to a grumbling; 

												    And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling; 

												    And out of the houses the rats came tumbling. 

												    Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats, 

												    Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats, 

												    Grave old plodders, gay young friskers, 

												    Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousins, 

												    Cocking tails and pricking whiskers, 

												    Families by tens and dozens,

												    Brothers, sisters, husbands, wivesäóî

												    Followed the Piper for their lives.

												    From street to street he piped advancing,

												    And step for step they followed dancing,

												    Until they came to the river Weser, 

												    Wherein all plunged and perished!
												  æ
												  äóîSave one, who, stout as Julius Cí_sar, 

												    Swam across and lived to carry 

												    (As he, the manuscript he cherished) 

												    To Rat-land home his commentary: 

												    Which was: "At the first shrill notes of the pipe, 

												    I heard a sound as of scraping tripe, 

												    And putting apples, wondrous ripe, 

												    Into a cider press's gripe; 

												    And a moving away of pickle-tub-boards, 

												    And a leaving ajar of conserve-cupboards, 

												    And a drawing the corks of train-oil-flasks, 

												    And a breaking the hoops of butter-casks: 

												    And it seemed as if a voice 

												    (Sweeter far than by harp or by psaltery 

												    Is breathed) called out, 'Oh, rats, rejoice! 

												    The world is grown to one vast drysaltery! 

												    So munch on, crunch on, take your nuncheon,

												    Breakfast, supper, dinner, luncheon!' 

												    And just as a bulky sugar-puncheon, 

												    Already staved, like a great sun shone 

												    Glorious scarce an inch before me, 

												    Just as methought it said, 'Come, bore me!' 

												    äóîI found the Weser rolling o'er me."
												  
												    VIII
											    
												  												    You should have heard the Hamelin people 

												    Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple. 

"Go," cried the Mayor, "and get long poles, 

Poke out the nests and block up the holes! 

Consult with carpenters and builders,

And leave in our town, not even a trace 

Of the rats!"äóîwhen suddenly, up the face 

Of the Piper perked in the market-place, 

With a, "First, if you please, my thousand guilders!"
											    
												    IX
											    
												  												    A thousand guilders! The Mayor looked blue; 

												    So did the Corporation, too. 

												    For council dinners made rare havoc 

												    With Claret, Moselle, Vin-de-Grave, Hock; 

												    And half the money would replenish 

												    Their cellar's biggest butt with Rhenish. 

												    To pay this sum to a wandering fellow 

												    With a gypsy coat of red and yellow! 

"Beside," quoth the Mayor, with a knowing wink, 

"Our business was done at the river's brink; 

We saw with our eyes the vermin sink, 

And what's dead can't come to life, I think.

So, friend, we're not the folks to shrink
												  From the duty of giving you something for drink, 

												    And a matter of money to put in your poke; 

												    But as for the guilders, what we spoke

												    Of them, as you very well know, was in joke. 

												    Beside, our losses have made us thrifty. 

											      A thousand guilders! Come, take fifty!"
												  
												    X
											    
												  												    The Piper's face fell, and he cried, 

  "No trifling! I can't wait! Beside, 

												    I've promised to visit by dinner-time 

												    Bagdat, and accept the prime 

												    Of the Head-Cook's pottage, all he's rich in, 

												    For having left, in the Caliph's kitchen,

												    Of a nest of scorpions no survivor: 

												    With him I proved no bargain-driver, 

												    With you, don't think I'll bate a stiver! 

												    And folks who put me in a passion 

												    May find me pipe after another fashion."
											    
												    XI
											    
												  "How?" cried the Mayor, "d'ye think I brook

												    Being worse treated than a cook? 

												    Insulted by a lazy ribald

												    With idle pipe and vesture piebald? 

												    You threaten us, fellow? Do your worst! 

												    Blow your pipe there till you burst!" 
											    
												    XII
											    
												  												    Once more he stept into the street, 

												    And to his lips again

												    Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane; 

												    And ere he blew three notes (such sweet,

												    Soft notes as yet musician's cunning 

												    Never gave the enraptured air)

												    There was a rustling that seemed like a bustling

												    Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling;

												    Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering, 

												    Little hands clapping, and little tongues chattering,

												    And, like fowls in a farm-yard, when barley is scattering,

												    Out came the children running.

												    All the little boys and girls.

												    With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,

												    And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,

												    Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after

												    The wonderful music with shouting and laughter. 
												  
												    XIII
											    
												  												    The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood 

												    As if they were changed into blocks of wood. 

												    Unable to move a step, or cry

												    To the children merrily skipping by, 

												    äóîCould only follow with the eye 

												    That joyous crowd at the piper's back. 

												    But how the Mayor was on the rack, 

												    And the wretched Council's bosom beat, 

												    As the Piper turned from the High Street 

												    To where the Weser rolled its waters, 

												    Right in the way of their sons and daughters! 

												    However, he turned from South to West, 

												    And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed,

												    And after him the children pressed: 

												    Great was the joy in every breast. 

"He never can cross that mighty top! 

He's forced to let the piping drop, 

And we shall see our children stop."

When lo, as they reached the mountain-side, 

A wondrous portal opened wide, 

As if a cavern were suddenly hollowed; 

And the Piper advanced, and the children followed, 

And when all were in, to the very last,

The door in the mountain-side shut fast. 

Did I say all? No! One was lame,

And could not dance the whole of the way; 

And in after years, if you would blame 

His sadness, he was used to say,äóî

"It's dull in our town since my playmates left! 

I can't forget that I'm bereft 

Of all the pleasant sights they see, 

Which the Piper also promised me. 

For he led us, he said, to a joyous land.

Joining the town, and just at hand, 

Where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew, 

And flowers put forth a fairer hue, 

And everything was strange and new: 

The sparrows were brighter than peacocks here, 

And their dogs outran our fallow deer. 

And honey-bees had lost their stings, 

And horses were born with eagles' wings; 

And just as I became assured, 

My lame foot would be speedily cured,

The music stopped and I stood still, 

And found myself outside the hill, 

Left alone against my will, 

To go now limping as before. 

And never hear of that country more!"
											    
												    XIV
											    
												  												    Alas, alas for Hamelin! 

												    There came into many a burgher's pate 

												    A text which says that Heaven's gate 

												    Opes to the rich at as easy a rate

												    As the needle's eye takes a camel in!

												    The Mayor sent East, West, North, and South,

												    To offer the Piper, by word of mouth, 

												    Wherever it was men's lot to find him,

												    Silver and gold to his heart's content,

												    If he'd only return the way he went, 

												    And bring the children behind him.

												    But when they saw 'twas a lost endeavor,

												    And Piper and dancers were gone forever,

												    They made a decree that lawyers never 

												    Should think their records dated duly 

												    If, after the day of the month and year,

												    These words did not as well appear,

"And so long after what happened here 

On the twenty-second of July,

Thirteen hundred and seventy-six;"

And the better in memory to fix

The place of the children's last retreat,

They called it the Pied Piper's Streetäóî

Where any one playing on pipe or tabor 

Was sure for the future to lose his labour.

Nor suffered they hostelry or tavern 

To shock with mirth a street so solemn;

But opposite the place of the cavern

They wrote the story on a column,

And on the great church window painted

The same, to make the world acquainted

How their children were stolen away.

And there it stands to this very day.

And I must not omit to say 

That in Transylvania there's a tribe

Of alien people who ascribe

The outlandish ways and dress

On which their neighbours lay such stress,

To their fathers and mothers having risen

Out of some subterraneous prison

Into which they were trepanned

Long time ago in a mighty band

Out of Hamelin town in Brunswick land,

But how or why, they don't understand. 
										        
											        XV
										        
											      												    So, Willy, let me and you be wipers

												    Of scores out with all menäóîespecially pipers! 

												    And, whether they pipe us free from rats or from mice,

												    If we've promised them aught, let us keep our promise!

The prairie-grass dividing, its special odor breathing,

												    I demand of it the spiritual corresponding,

												    Demand the most copious and close companionship of men,

												    Demand the blades to rise of words, acts, beings,

												    Those of the open atmosphere, coarse, sunlit, fresh, nutritious,

												    Those that go their own gait, erect, stepping with freedom and

												    command, leading not following,

												    Those with a never-quell'd audacity, those with sweet and lusty

												    flesh clear of taint,

												    Those that look carelessly in the faces of Presidents and governors,

												    as to say Who are you?

												    Those of earth-born passion, simple, never constrain'd, never obedient,

											      Those of inland America.

From Circling The Core (Enitharmon Press 2008)
											    
												  My first reaction is: I want it,

												    canäó»t wait to squeeze into

												    a scarlet sheath that promises

												    breasts round as russet apples,

												    a waist pinched to a pencil,

												    hips that know the whole dictionary

												    of swaying, canäó»t wait 

												    to saunter down an August street

											    with every eye upon me.
											    æ
										        But the moment Iäó»m zipped in

												    I canäó»t breathe and the fabric 

												    hugging my stomach without mercy

												    pronounces me a frump.

												    Besides, in the internet cafí©,

												    where you can phone Tangiers

												    or Thailand for almost nothing

												    fourteen pairs of eyes

												    are absorbed by screens.

												    No one whistles when I smile

												    at boxes of tired mangoes 

												    and seedy broccoli heads 

												    outside the Greek superstore.
										        æ
											    By now Iäó»m in a fever to undo

												    the garment and pull it off.

												    And for all its flaws, for all

												    that it only boasts one breast,

												    Iäó»m overjoyed to re-possess

												    my body. I remember I hate 

												    holding in and shutting away.

												    What I want is a dress easy

												    as a plump plum oozing

												    juice, as a warm afternoon

												    in late October creeping 

												    its ambers and cinnamons into 

												    leaves, a dress that reasssures 

												    thereäó»s no need to pretend, 

												    a dress thatäó»s as capacious 

												    as generosity, a dress that willingly

												    unbuttons and whispers in the ear:

												    be alive every minute of your life.

See how these cut reeds float down

												    the Tigris to the reed-nets of Suweira,

												    through fields and farmlands

												    green and ploughed, allotments,

												    orchards; past the piers where

												    fishing boats tie up against the night,

												    sliding north of the Sasanid ruins;

												    through Babylon and Persia, sixty miles

												    as the bomber flies, twice that

												    twisting through tended groves

												    and dusty weed-blown lots.

												    Here the sun is hot as they float

												    in the main stream. Dark at night

											    they drift, tumbling the waters of the dead.
												  æ
												  In the mornings, the fishermen of Suweira go

											    out in boats to free the reed-nets.
												  æ
												  This happens every day -

												    two or three a day. We find them

												    in the net, which is there for the floating reeds.

												    Wait,  his body is rotten, his belly is

												    cut open - he can't be lifted out.

												    Does he have a head? No, its been cut off.

												    Power up well drag him out.
												  æ
												  See how they wind these reeds in plastic,

												    keep them on the shore till someone comes

												    from Suweira to take them east to Kut.
												  æ
												  Has the body been shot, does it have bullet wounds?

												    Yes, his  robe is full of holes,

												    Is the body handcuffed and blindfolded?

												    No, it isnäó»t, but his face is marked

												    and we found bullets.
												  æ
												  So far we have received

												    about five hundred bodies.

												    They are men of military age.

												    We have also received about ten women.

												    Most have been shot or tortured.

												    They are much decomposed, so

												    you cant be near them for long.

												    They have floated at least three days

												    to come to Suweira.
												  æ
												  We seek identifying marks on the body,

												    because he has no name, or anything else,

												    we rely on these marks. Sometimes the body

												    has a tattoo from which we can identify him.
												  æ
												  My brother went missing was on his way

												    to Baghdad. He was murdered in Yusufiya

												    with a group of men. We found the body

												    of one who was with him heäó»d been handcuffed

												    and blindfolded and shot three times in the head.

												    There were clear signs of torture on his body.
												  æ
												  Weäó»ve been looking for my son

												    and three other men who were with him.

												    Some people told us to go to Suweira.

												    I came here. They said, Go to Kut,

												    I came to the hospital in Kut

												    and we found him with the others.
												  æ
												  See how this dross that has

												    floated down the Tigris to Suweira

												    now rots in the heat: At the graveyard

												    they dust the bodies, bury them

												    shallow in their clothes in the section

												    for those from the reed nets.
												  æ
												  We could wash the body with water

												    but it is often too decomposed.

												    The hair and nails will fall out

												    if we wash them, and that is haram.
												  æ
												  6563. 26 May. Female.

												    Write down a description of her clothes.

												    What is she wearing? An embroidered gown...

												    Move her head from this side. Take a picture of her.
												  æ
								                2656. This is her number. Put it close to her head,

												    OK, now throw the dust on her.
								                æ
											    See, even as the dry earth settles,

												    more are coming on the rivers back,

												    gently rounding the many bends

												    down to where the nets of Suweira

												    strain against the unrelenting wateräó»s flow.



War Poems

#######################################################

At Flores in the Azores Sir Richard Grenville lay,

												    And a pinnace, like a fluttered bird, came flying from far away:

"Spanish ships of war at sea! we have sighted fifty-three!"

Then sware Lord Thomas Howard: "'Fore God I am no coward;

												    But I cannot meet them here, for my ships are out of gear,

												    And the half my men are sick. I must fly, but follow quick.

											      We are six ships of the line; can we fight with fifty-three?"
												  æ
												  Then spake Sir Richard Grenville: "I know you are no coward;

												    You fly them for a moment to fight with them again.

												    But I've ninety men and more that are lying sick ashore.

												    I should count myself the coward if I left them, my Lord Howard,

												    To these Inquisition dogs and the devildoms of Spain."
												  æ
												  So Lord Howard passed away with five ships of war that day,

												    Till he melted like a cloud in the silent summer heaven;

												    But Sir Richard bore in hand all his sick men from the land

												    Very carefully and slow,

												    Men of Bideford in Devon,

												    And we laid them on the ballast down below;

												    For we brought them all aboard,

												    And they blest him in their pain, that they were not left to Spain,

												    To the thumbscrew and the stake, for the glory of the Lord.
												  æ
												  He had only a hundred seamen to work the ship and to fight,

												    And he sailed away from Flores till the Spaniard came in sight,

												    With his huge sea-castles heaving upon the weather bow.

												    "Shall we fight or shall we fly?

												    Good Sir Richard, tell us now,

												    For to fight is but to die!

												    There'll be little of us left by the time this sun be set."

												    And Sir Richard said again: "We be all good English men.

												    Let us bang these dogs of Seville, the children of the devil,

												    For I never turned my back upon Don or devil yet."
												  æ
												  Sir Richard spoke and he laughed, and we roared a hurrah, and so

												    The little Revenge ran on sheer into the heart of the foe,

												    With her hundred fighters on deck, and her ninety sick below;

												    For half of their fleet to the right and half to the left were seen,

												    And the little Revenge ran on through the long sea-lane between.
												  æ
												  Thousands of their soldiers looked down from their decks and laughed,

												    Thousands of their seamen made mock at the mad little craft

												    Running on and on, till delayed

												    By their mountain-like San Philip that, of fifteen hundred tons,

												    And up-shadowing high above us with her yawning tiers of guns,

												    Took the breath from our sails, and we stayed.
												  æ
												  And while now the great San Philip hung above us like a cloud

												    Whence the thunderbolt will fall

												    Long and loud,

												    Four galleons drew away

												    From the Spanish fleet that day,

												    And two upon the larboard and two upon the starboard lay,

												    And the battle-thunder broke from them all.
												  æ
												  But anon the great San Philip, she bethought herself and went

												    Having that within her womb that had left her ill content;

												    And the rest they came aboard us, and they fought us hand to hand,

												    For a dozen times they came with their pikes and musqueteers,

												    And a dozen times we shook 'em off as a dog that shakes his ears

												    When he leaps from the water to the land.
												  æ
												  And the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer sea,

												    But never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three.

												    Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came,

												    Ship after ship, the whole night long, with her battle-thunder and flame;

												    Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and her shame.

												    For some were sunk and many were shattered, and so could fight us no more - 

												    God of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before?
												  æ
												  For he said "Fight on! fight on!"

												    Though his vessel was all but a wreck;

												    And it chanced that, when half of the short summer night was gone,

												    With a grisly wound to be dressed he had left the deck,

												    But a bullet struck him that was dressing it suddenly dead,

												    And himself he was wounded again in the side and the head,

												    And he said "Fight on! fight on!"
												  æ
												  And the night went down, and the sun smiled out far over the summer sea,

												    And the Spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring;

												    But they dared not touch us again, for they feared that we still could sting,

												    So they watched what the end would be.

												    And we had not fought them in vain,

												    But in perilous plight were we,

												    Seeing forty of our poor hundred were slain,

												    And half of the rest of us maimed for life

												    In the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife;

												    And the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and cold,

												    And the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was all of it spent;

												    And the masts and the rigging were lying over the side;

												    But Sir Richard cried in his English pride,

												    "We have fought such a fight for a day and a night

												    As may never be fought again!

												    We have won great glory, my men!

												    And a day less or more

												    At sea or ashore,

												    We die -does it matter when?

												    Sink me the ship, Master Gunner -sink her, split her in twain!

												    Fall into the hands of God, not into the hands of Spain!"
												  æ
												  And the gunner said "Ay, ay," but the seamen made reply:

												    "We have children, we have wives,

												    And the Lord hath spared our lives.

												    We will make the Spaniard promise, if we yield, to let us go;

												    We shall live to fight again and to strike another blow."

												    And the lion there lay dying, and they yielded to the foe.
												  æ
												  And the stately Spanish men to their flagship bore him then,

												    Where they laid him by the mast, old Sir Richard caught at last,

												    And they praised him to his face with their courtly foreign grace;

												    But he rose upon their decks, and he cried:

												    "I have fought for Queen and Faith like a valiant man and true;

												    I have only done my duty as a man is bound to do:

												    With a joyful spirit I Sir Richard Grenville die!"

												    And he fell upon their decks, and he died.
												  æ
												  And they stared at the dead that had been so valiant and true,

												    And had holden the power and glory of Spain so cheap

												    That he dared her with one little ship and his English few;

												    Was he devil or man? He was devil for aught they knew,

												    But they sank his body with honour down into the deep,

												    And they manned the Revenge with a swarthier alien crew,

												    And away she sailed with her loss and longed for her own;

												    When a wind from the lands they had ruined awoke from sleep,

												    And the water began to heave and the weather to moan,

												    And or ever that evening ended a great gale blew,

												    And a wave like the wave that is raised by an earthquake grew,

												    Till it smote on their hulls and their sails and their masts and their flags,

												    And the whole sea plunged and fell on the shot-shattered navy of Spain,

												    And the little Revenge herself went down by the island crags

											    To be lost evermore in the main.



Love

#######################################################

While my hair was still cut straight across my forehead
I played about the front gate, pulling flowers.
You came by on bamboo stilts, playing horse,
You walked about my seat, playing with blue plums.
And we went on living in the village of Chokan:
Two small people, without dislike or suspicion.
At fourteen I married My Lord you.
I never laughed, being bashful.
Lowering my head, I looked at the wall.
Called to, a thousand times, I never looked back.

At fifteen I stopped scowling,
I desired my dust to be mingled with yours
Forever and forever, and forever.
Why should I climb the look out?

At sixteen you departed
You went into far Ku-to-en, by the river of swirling eddies,
And you have been gone five months.
The monkeys make sorrowful noise overhead.

You dragged your feet when you went out.
By the gate now, the moss is grown, the different mosses,
Too deep to clear them away!
The leaves fall early this autumn, in wind.
The paired butterflies are already yellow with August
Over the grass in the West garden;
They hurt me.
I grow older.
If you are coming down through the narrows of the river Kiang,
Please let me know beforehand,
And I will come out to meet you
As far as Cho-fu-Sa.

There once was

												    a sage

												    with a sage's white beard

												    and a sage's flowing robe

												    who shunned royal titles

												    and the life of palace

												    so no rubies were braided in his beard

												    but dandelions, and dewdrops

												    as he would rather gaze at the night sky

											    from the wildest mountain creeks
												  æ
												  his eye was sharp

												    and sharper was his mind

												    and one fateful night he strung together

												    with thin thread of pure will

												    every star in the firmament

												    - and not half a dozen into a silly constellation

												    like palace astronomers do

												    ("those are Suns and not apples"

											    he would say disdainful)
												  æ
												  a most beautiful image he had thus conjured

												    in a peak far north

												    slowly gyrating like a Dervish in the snow

												    to encompass the celestial vault

												    ten thousand stars embroidered in the night

											    that tell all there is
												  æ
										        alas

												    when he tried to reveal 

												    his vision

												    he realized no one else

												    could make sense 

												    of the glistening tapestry hanging in the sky
										        æ
											    "Scorpius is but the spearhead of Treason"

												    he would explain

												    "and Sirius burns brightest for it is the centre of Loveäó_"

												    at which point no one would listen anymore

												    for Kings and commoners alike

												    are fearful of the Truth



Religious Poems

A strange thing the preacher said,

												    And proved it by the Book.

												    He told all people who could hear

												    To watch and wait, and look

												    To see their risen Lord appear,

											    That Jesus who was dead.
												  æ
												  How curious it will be!

												    The blue, familiar sky

												    Cracked open suddenly.

												    Broken from east to west

												    Like an old dish, a bowl,

												    Blue china, just now whole,

												    Now broken, as though dropped

												    By a careless maid. Then stopped

												    Will be all laughter, and the sun,

												    His long course run,

												    Will stand still suddenly,

												    And people in the street

												    Will stop and look to see

												    Archangels pass and meet,

												    A light--music, maybe--

												    Angelic hosts and choirs,

												    And saints bowing before

												    A shining, swinging door

											    And tending altar fires.
												  æ
												  How the thief will stay

												    His furtive, skillful hand!

												    What will the liar say?

												    The plotter, quite confused,

												    Will face the true judgment,

												    Sly men with ill intent

												    Will stagger, faint at heart

												    No one may stand apart

												    And claim a separate case.

												    We must stand face to face

												    With Him who lived and died,

												    He whom men crucified,

												    He rose again,

											    And judges men.
												  æ
												  If He should come today

												    We'd see the soldiers stand

												    Each with his tool in hand.

												    The drowned from the deep sea

												    Would bring old jewels caught

												    In their wet, streaming hair.

												    What secrets will be there

												    When from old graves the dead

												    Creep whispering! Overhead

												    A rain of shining wings,

												    Scents, colors, and such things

												    As we have never seen or known

											    Poured from the great, white Throne!
												  æ
												  We do not all believe.

												    No, there are some who say

												    That these old tales deceive,

												    And day will follow day

												    To some logical end.

												    We shall still earn and spend,

												    Eat, sleep, and by and by

												    Stop struggling and die.

												    And some have never heard,

												    And some men do not care.

												    How they will stand and stare

												    When stars remember the lost word

												    And sing, and the skies fall!

												    That high, blue, shining wall

												    Of Heaven--larkspur blue--

												    Will crumble and fall down,

												    And flame encircle all the earth

											    Like a great jeweled crown.
												  æ
										        Will any of us cry out?

												    "O God," will someone say,

												    "Why don't you put some of these things

												    In a great box with fastenings,

												    With locks and seals--to use again,

												    To give, perhaps, to other men

												    On worlds less lovely than this one

												    Whose day is ended and whose work is done!

												    In Heaven is there no treasury

												    For beauty of this earth and sea?

												    Green fields that never sinned,

												    And flowers innocent,

												    White highways where the wind

												    Ran between faithful trees,

												    And valleys redolent

												    Of green herbs where the bees

												    Go honey seeking--these--

												    Have you no use for them?"
										        æ
											    And we who love the turquoise cave,

												    Will there be some among us who

												    Will try to catch the stars and save

												    Some bits of immemorial blue

												    To carry with us, like the shells

												    That children carry from the sea,

												    For keepsakes in eternity?



War Poems

#######################################################

We'd found an old Boche dug-out, and he knew,

												    And gave us hell, for shell on frantic shell

												    Hammered on top, but never quite burst through.

												    Rain, guttering down in waterfalls of slime

												    Kept slush waist high, that rising hour by hour,

												    Choked up the steps too thick with clay to climb.

												    What murk of air remained stank old, and sour

												    With fumes of whizz-bangs, and the smell of men

												    Who'd lived there years, and left their curse in the den,

												    If not their corpses. . . .												    There we herded from the blast

												    Of whizz-bangs, but one found our door at last.

												    Buffeting eyes and breath, snuffing the candles.

												    And thud! flump! thud! down the steep steps came thumping

												    And splashing in the flood, deluging muck --

												    The sentry's body; then his rifle, handles

												    Of old Boche bombs, and mud in ruck on ruck.

												    We dredged him up, for killed, until he whined

  "O sir, my eyes -- I'm blind -- I'm blind, I'm blind!"

												    Coaxing, I held a flame against his lids

												    And said if he could see the least blurred light

												    He was not blind; in time he'd get all right.

  "I can't," he sobbed. Eyeballs, huge-bulged like squids

												    Watch my dreams still; but I forgot him there

												    In posting next for duty, and sending a scout

												    To beg a stretcher somewhere, and floundering about

												    To other posts under the shrieking air. 
												  æ
												  Those other wretches, how they bled and spewed,

												    And one who would have drowned himself for good, --

												    I try not to remember these things now.

												    Let dread hark back for one word only: how

												    Half-listening to that sentry's moans and jumps,

												    And the wild chattering of his broken teeth,

												    Renewed most horribly whenever crumps

												    Pummelled the roof and slogged the air beneath --

												    Through the dense din, I say, we heard him shout

												    "I see your lights!" But ours had long died out.



Narrative Poems

#######################################################

Paul Jannes was working very late,

												    For this watch must be done by eight

												    To-morrow or the Cardinal

												    Would certainly be vexed.  Of all

												    His customers the old prelate

												    Was the most important, for his state

												    Descended to his watches and rings,

												    And he gave his mistresses many things

												    To make them forget his age and smile

												    When he paid visits, and they could while

												    The time away with a diamond locket

												    Exceedingly well.  So they picked his pocket,

												    And he paid in jewels for his slobbering kisses.

												    This watch was made to buy him blisses

												    From an Austrian countess on her way

											    Home, and she meant to start next day.
												  

											        
												  Paul worked by the pointed, tulip-flame

												    Of a tallow candle, and became

												    So absorbed, that his old clock made him wince

												    Striking the hour a moment since.

												    Its echo, only half apprehended,

												    Lingered about the room.  He ended

												    Screwing the little rubies in,

												    Setting the wheels to lock and spin,

												    Curling the infinitesimal springs,

												    Fixing the filigree hands.  Chippings

												    Of precious stones lay strewn about.

												    The table before him was a rout

												    Of splashes and sparks of coloured light.

												    There was yellow gold in sheets, and quite

												    A heap of emeralds, and steel.

												    Here was a gem, there was a wheel.

												    And glasses lay like limpid lakes

												    Shining and still, and there were flakes

												    Of silver, and shavings of pearl,

												    And little wires all awhirl

												    With the light of the candle.  He took the watch

												    And wound its hands about to match

												    The time, then glanced up to take the hour

												    From the hanging clock.

												    Good, Merciful Power!

												    How came that shadow on the wall,

												    No woman was in the room!  His tall

												    Chiffonier stood gaunt behind

												    His chair.  His old cloak, rabbit-lined,

												    Hung from a peg.  The door was closed.

												    Just for a moment he must have dozed.

												    He looked again, and saw it plain.

												    The silhouette made a blue-black stain

												    On the opposite wall, and it never wavered

												    Even when the candle quavered

												    Under his panting breath.  What made

												    That beautiful, dreadful thing, that shade

												    Of something so lovely, so exquisite,

												    Cast from a substance which the sight

												    Had not been tutored to perceive?

												    Paul brushed his eyes across his sleeve.
												  æ
												  Clear-cut, the Shadow on the wall

											    Gleamed black, and never moved at all.
												  

											          
												  Paul's watches were like amulets,

												    Wrought into patterns and rosettes;

												    The cases were all set with stones,

												    And wreathing lines, and shining zones.

												    He knew the beauty in a curve,

												    And the Shadow tortured every nerve

												    With its perfect rhythm of outline

												    Cutting the whitewashed wall.  So fine

												    Was the neck he knew he could have spanned

												    It about with the fingers of one hand.

												    The chin rose to a mouth he guessed,

												    But could not see, the lips were pressed

												    Loosely together, the edges close,

												    And the proud and delicate line of the nose

												    Melted into a brow, and there

												    Broke into undulant waves of hair.

												    The lady was edged with the stamp of race.

											    A singular vision in such a place.
												  

											          
												  He moved the candle to the tall

												    Chiffonier; the Shadow stayed on the wall.

												    He threw his cloak upon a chair,

												    And still the lady's face was there.

												    From every corner of the room

												    He saw, in the patch of light, the gloom

												    That was the lady.  Her violet bloom

												    Was almost brighter than that which came

												    From his candle's tulip-flame.

												    He set the filigree hands; he laid

												    The watch in the case which he had made;

												    He put on his rabbit cloak, and snuffed

												    His candle out.  The room seemed stuffed

												    With darkness.  Softly he crossed the floor,

											    And let himself out through the door.
												  

											          
												  The sun was flashing from every pin

												    And wheel, when Paul let himself in.

												    The whitewashed walls were hot with light.

												    The room was the core of a chrysolite,

												    Burning and shimmering with fiery might.

												    The sun was so bright that no shadow could fall

												    From the furniture upon the wall.

												    Paul sighed as he looked at the empty space

												    Where a glare usurped the lady's place.

												    He settled himself to his work, but his mind

												    Wandered, and he would wake to find

												    His hand suspended, his eyes grown dim,

												    And nothing advanced beyond the rim

												    Of his dreaming.  The Cardinal sent to pay

												    For his watch, which had purchased so fine a day.

												    But Paul could hardly touch the gold,

												    It seemed the price of his Shadow, sold.

												    With the first twilight he struck a match

												    And watched the little blue stars hatch

												    Into an egg of perfect flame.

												    He lit his candle, and almost in shame

												    At his eagerness, lifted his eyes.

												    The Shadow was there, and its precise

												    Outline etched the cold, white wall.

												    The young man swore, "By God!  You, Paul,

												    There's something the matter with your brain.

											    Go home now and sleep off the strain."
												  

											          
												  The next day was a storm, the rain

												    Whispered and scratched at the window-pane.

												    A grey and shadowless morning filled

												    The little shop.  The watches, chilled,

												    Were dead and sparkless as burnt-out coals.

												    The gems lay on the table like shoals

												    Of stranded shells, their colours faded,

												    Mere heaps of stone, dull and degraded.

												    Paul's head was heavy, his hands obeyed

												    No orders, for his fancy strayed.

												    His work became a simple round

												    Of watches repaired and watches wound.

												    The slanting ribbons of the rain

												    Broke themselves on the window-pane,

												    But Paul saw the silver lines in vain.

												    Only when the candle was lit

												    And on the wall just opposite

												    He watched again the coming of IT,

												    Could he trace a line for the joy of his soul

											    And over his hands regain control.
												  

											          
												  Paul lingered late in his shop that night

												    And the designs which his delight

												    Sketched on paper seemed to be

												    A tribute offered wistfully

												    To the beautiful shadow of her who came

												    And hovered over his candle flame.

												    In the morning he selected all

												    His perfect jacinths.  One large opal

												    Hung like a milky, rainbow moon

												    In the centre, and blown in loose festoon

												    The red stones quivered on silver threads

												    To the outer edge, where a single, fine

												    Band of mother-of-pearl the line

												    Completed.  On the other side,

												    The creamy porcelain of the face

												    Bore diamond hours, and no lace

												    Of cotton or silk could ever be

												    Tossed into being more airily

												    Than the filmy golden hands; the time

												    Seemed to tick away in rhyme.

												    When, at dusk, the Shadow grew

												    Upon the wall, Paul's work was through.

												    Holding the watch, he spoke to her:

												    "Lady, Beautiful Shadow, stir

												    Into one brief sign of being.

												    Turn your eyes this way, and seeing

												    This watch, made from those sweet curves

												    Where your hair from your forehead swerves,

												    Accept the gift which I have wrought

												    With your fairness in my thought.

												    Grant me this, and I shall be

												    Honoured overwhelmingly."
												  æ
												  The Shadow rested black and still,

											    And the wind sighed over the window-sill.
												  

											          
												  Paul put the despised watch away

												    And laid out before him his array

												    Of stones and metals, and when the morning

												    Struck the stones to their best adorning,

												    He chose the brightest, and this new watch

												    Was so light and thin it seemed to catch

												    The sunlight's nothingness, and its gleam.

												    Topazes ran in a foamy stream

												    Over the cover, the hands were studded

												    With garnets, and seemed red roses, budded.

												    The face was of crystal, and engraved

												    Upon it the figures flashed and waved

												    With zircons, and beryls, and amethysts.

												    It took a week to make, and his trysts

												    At night with the Shadow were his alone.

												    Paul swore not to speak till his task was done.

												    The night that the jewel was worthy to give.

												    Paul watched the long hours of daylight live

												    To the faintest streak; then lit his light,

												    And sharp against the wall's pure white

												    The outline of the Shadow started

												    Into form.  His burning-hearted

												    Words so long imprisoned swelled

												    To tumbling speech.  Like one compelled,

												    He told the lady all his love,

												    And holding out the watch above

												    His head, he knelt, imploring some

												    Littlest sign.

											    The Shadow was dumb.
												  

											          
												  Weeks passed, Paul worked in fevered haste,

												    And everything he made he placed

												    Before his lady.  The Shadow kept

												    Its perfect passiveness.  Paul wept.

												    He wooed her with the work of his hands,

												    He waited for those dear commands

												    She never gave.  No word, no motion,

												    Eased the ache of his devotion.

												    His days passed in a strain of toil,

												    His nights burnt up in a seething coil.

												    Seasons shot by, uncognisant

												    He worked.  The Shadow came to haunt

												    Even his days.  Sometimes quite plain

												    He saw on the wall the blackberry stain

												    Of his lady's picture.  No sun was bright

											    Enough to dazzle that from his sight.
												  

											          
												  There were moments when he groaned to see

												    His life spilled out so uselessly,

												    Begging for boons the Shade refused,

												    His finest workmanship abused,

												    The iridescent bubbles he blew

												    Into lovely existence, poor and few

												    In the shadowed eyes.  Then he would curse

												    Himself and her!  The Universe!

												    And more, the beauty he could not make,

												    And give her, for her comfort's sake!

												    He would beat his weary, empty hands

												    Upon the table, would hold up strands

												    Of silver and gold, and ask her why

												    She scorned the best which he could buy.

												    He would pray as to some high-niched saint,

												    That she would cure him of the taint

												    Of failure.  He would clutch the wall

												    With his bleeding fingers, if she should fall

												    He could catch, and hold her, and make her live!

												    With sobs he would ask her to forgive

												    All he had done.  And broken, spent,

												    He would call himself impertinent;

												    Presumptuous; a tradesman; a nothing; driven

												    To madness by the sight of Heaven.

												    At other times he would take the things

												    He had made, and winding them on strings,

												    Hang garlands before her, and burn perfumes,

												    Chanting strangely, while the fumes

												    Wreathed and blotted the shadow face,

												    As with a cloudy, nacreous lace.

												    There were days when he wooed as a lover, sighed

												    In tenderness, spoke to his bride,

												    Urged her to patience, said his skill

												    Should break the spell.  A man's sworn will

												    Could compass life, even that, he knew.

												    By Christ's Blood!  He would prove it true!
												  æ
												  The edge of the Shadow never blurred.

											    The lips of the Shadow never stirred.
												  

											          
												  He would climb on chairs to reach her lips,

												    And pat her hair with his finger-tips.

												    But instead of young, warm flesh returning

												    His warmth, the wall was cold and burning

												    Like stinging ice, and his passion, chilled,

												    Lay in his heart like some dead thing killed

												    At the moment of birth.  Then, deadly sick,

												    He would lie in a swoon for hours, while thick

												    Phantasmagoria crowded his brain,

												    And his body shrieked in the clutch of pain.

												    The crisis passed, he would wake and smile

												    With a vacant joy, half-imbecile

												    And quite confused, not being certain

												    Why he was suffering; a curtain

												    Fallen over the tortured mind beguiled

												    His sorrow.  Like a little child

												    He would play with his watches and gems, with glee

												    Calling the Shadow to look and see

												    How the spots on the ceiling danced prettily

												    When he flashed his stones.  "Mother, the green

												    Has slid so cunningly in between

												    The blue and the yellow.  Oh, please look down!"

												    Then, with a pitiful, puzzled frown,

												    He would get up slowly from his play

												    And walk round the room, feeling his way

												    From table to chair, from chair to door,

												    Stepping over the cracks in the floor,

												    Till reaching the table again, her face

												    Would bring recollection, and no solace

												    Could balm his hurt till unconsciousness

											    Stifled him and his great distress.
												  

											          
												  One morning he threw the street door wide

												    On coming in, and his vigorous stride

												    Made the tools on his table rattle and jump.

												    In his hands he carried a new-burst clump

												    Of laurel blossoms, whose smooth-barked stalks

												    Were pliant with sap.  As a husband talks

												    To the wife he left an hour ago,

												    Paul spoke to the Shadow.  "Dear, you know

												    To-day the calendar calls it Spring,

												    And I woke this morning gathering

												    Asphodels, in my dreams, for you.

												    So I rushed out to see what flowers blew

												    Their pink-and-purple-scented souls

												    Across the town-wind's dusty scrolls,

												    And made the approach to the Market Square

												    A garden with smells and sunny air.

												    I feel so well and happy to-day,

												    I think I shall take a Holiday.

												    And to-night we will have a little treat.

												    I am going to bring you something to eat!"

												    He looked at the Shadow anxiously.

												    It was quite grave and silent.  He

												    Shut the outer door and came

												    And leant against the window-frame.

												    "Dearest," he said, "we live apart

												    Although I bear you in my heart.

												    We look out each from a different world.

												    At any moment we may be hurled

												    Asunder.  They follow their orbits, we

												    Obey their laws entirely.

												    Now you must come, or I go there,

												    Unless we are willing to live the flare

												    Of a lighted instant and have it gone."
												  æ
												  A bee in the laurels began to drone.

												    A loosened petal fluttered prone.
												  æ
												  "Man grows by eating, if you eat

												    You will be filled with our life, sweet

												    Will be our planet in your mouth.

												    If not, I must parch in death's wide drouth

												    Until I gain to where you are,

												    And give you myself in whatever star

												    May happen.  O You Beloved of Me!

												    Is it not ordered cleverly?"
												  æ
												  The Shadow, bloomed like a plum, and clear,

											    Hung in the sunlight.  It did not hear.
												  

											          
												  Paul slipped away as the dusk began

												    To dim the little shop.  He ran

												    To the nearest inn, and chose with care

												    As much as his thin purse could bear.

												    As rapt-souled monks watch over the baking

												    Of the sacred wafer, and through the making

												    Of the holy wine whisper secret prayers

												    That God will bless this labour of theirs;

												    So Paul, in a sober ecstasy,

												    Purchased the best which he could buy.

												    Returning, he brushed his tools aside,

												    And laid across the table a wide

												    Napkin.  He put a glass and plate

												    On either side, in duplicate.

												    Over the lady's, excellent

												    With loveliness, the laurels bent.

												    In the centre the white-flaked pastry stood,

												    And beside it the wine flask.  Red as blood

												    Was the wine which should bring the lustihood

												    Of human life to his lady's veins.

												    When all was ready, all which pertains

												    To a simple meal was there, with eyes

												    Lit by the joy of his great emprise,

												    He reverently bade her come,

												    And forsake for him her distant home.

												    He put meat on her plate and filled her glass,

												    And waited what should come to pass.
												  æ
												  The Shadow lay quietly on the wall.

												    From the street outside came a watchman's call

												    "A cloudy night.  Rain beginning to fall."
												  æ
												  And still he waited.  The clock's slow tick

												    Knocked on the silence.  Paul turned sick.
												  æ
												  He filled his own glass full of wine;

												    From his pocket he took a paper.  The twine

												    Was knotted, and he searched a knife

												    From his jumbled tools.  The cord of life

												    Snapped as he cut the little string.

												    He knew that he must do the thing

												    He feared.  He shook powder into the wine,

												    And holding it up so the candle's shine

												    Sparked a ruby through its heart,

												    He drank it.  "Dear, never apart

												    Again!  You have said it was mine to do.

											    It is done, and I am come to you!"
												  

											          
												  Paul Jannes let the empty wine-glass fall,

												    And held out his arms.  The insentient wall

												    Stared down at him with its cold, white glare

												    Unstained!  The Shadow was not there!

												    Paul clutched and tore at his tightening throat.

												    He felt the veins in his body bloat,

												    And the hot blood run like fire and stones

												    Along the sides of his cracking bones.

												    But he laughed as he staggered towards the door,

												    And he laughed aloud as he sank on the floor.

												  The Coroner took the body away,

												    The Auctioneer said one could seldom buy

											    Such watches, and the prices were high.



War Poems

I
											    
												  All night long, it has seemed for many years,

												    We have heard the terrible sound of guns,

												    All night long we have lain and watched the calm stars.

												    We cannot sleep, though we are tired,

												    The sound of guns is in our ears,

												    We are growing old and grey,

												    We have forgotten many simple things.

												    Is this you? Is this I?

												    Will the word come to charge today?...

												    All night long, all night long,

												    We listen and cannot close our eyes,

												    We see the ring of violet flashes

												    Endlessly darting against the skies,

												    We feel the firm earth shake beneath us,

												    And all the world we have walked upon

												    Crumbles to nothing, crumbles to chaos,

												    Crumbles to incoherent dust;

												    Till it seems we can never walk again,

												    That it is foolish to have feet, foolish to be men,

												    Foolish to think, foolish to have such brains,

												    And useless to remember

												    The world we came from,

												    The world we never shall see again ...

												    All night long we lie this way,

												    We cannot talk, I look to see what you are thinking,

												    And you, and you,--

												    We are all thinking, 'Will it come to-day?'

												    Get your bayonets ready, then--

												    See that they are sharp and bright,

												    See that they h ave thirsty edges,

												    Remember that we are savage men,

												    Motherless men who have no past ...

												    Nothing of beauty to call to mind,

												    No tenderness to stay our hands ...

												    ... We are tired, we have thought all this before,

												    We have seen it all and thought it all,

												    Our thumbs are calloused with feeling the bayonet's edge,

												    We have known it all and felt it all

												    Till we can know no more.
											    
												    II
											    
												  All night long we lie

												    Stupidly watching the smoke puff over the sky,

												    Stupidly watching the interminable stars

												    Come out again, peaceful and cold and high,

												    Swim into the smoke again, or melt in a flare of red ...

												    All night long, all night long,

												    Hearing the terrible battle of guns,

												    We think we shall soon be dead,

												    We sleep for a second, and wake again,

												    We dream we are filling pans and baking bread,

												    Or hoeing the witch-grass out of the wheat,

												    We dream we are turning lathes,

												    Or open our shops, in the early morning,

												    And look for a moment along the quiet street ...

												    And we do not laugh, though it is strange

												    In a harrowing second of time

												    To traverse so many worlds, so many ages,

												    And come to this chaos again,

												    This vast symphonic dance of death,

												    This incoherent dust.
											    
												    III
											    
												  We are growing old, we are older than the stars:

												    You whom I knew a moment ago

												    Have walked through ages of silence since then,

												    Memory is forsaking me,

												    I no longer know

												    If we are one or two or the blades of grass ...

												    All night long, lying together,

												    We think in caverns of dreadful sound,

												    We grope among falling boulders,

												    We are overtaken and crushed, we rise once more,

												    Performing, wearily,

												    The senseless things we have performed so often before.

												    Yesterday is coming again,

												    Yesterday and the day before,

												    And a million others, all alike, one by one,

												    Sulphurous clouds and a red sun,

												    Sulphurous clouds and a yellow moon,

												    And a cold drizzle of endless rain

												    Driving across them, wetting the barrels of guns,

												    Dripping, soaking, pattering, slipping,

												    Chilling our hands, numbing our feet,

												    Glistening on our chins.

												    And then, all over again, after grey ages,

												    Sulphurous clouds and a red sun,

												    Sulphurous clouds and a yellow moon ...

												    I had my childhood once, now I have children,

												    A boy who is learning to read, a girl who is learning to sew,

												    And my wife has brown hair and blue eyes ...

												    Our parapet is blown away,

												    Blown away by a gust of sound,

												    Dust is falling upon us, blood is dripping upon us,

												    We are standing somewhere between earth and stars,

												    Not knowing if we are alive or dead ...

												    All night long it is so,

												    All night long we hear the guns, and do not know

												    If the word will come to charge to-day.
											    
												    IV
											    
												  It will be like that other charge--

												    We will climb out and run

												    Yelling like madmen in the sun

												    Running stiffly on the scorched dust

												    Hardly hearing our voices

												    Running after the man who points with his hand

												    At a certain shattered tree,

												    Running through sheets of fire like idiots,

												    Sometimes falling, sometimes rising.

												    I will not remember, then,

												    How I walked by a hedge of wild roses,

												    And shook the dew off, with my sleeve,

												    I will not remember

												    The shape of my sweetheart's mouth, but with other things

												    Ringing like anvils in my brain

												    I will run, I will die, I will forget.

												    I will hear nothing, and forget ...

												    I will remember that we are savage men,

												    Motherless men who have no past,

												    Nothing of beauty to call to mind

												    No tenderness to stay our hands ...
											    
												    V
											    
												  We are tired, we have thought all this before,

												    We have seen it all, and thought it all.

												    We have tried to forget, we have tried to change,

												    We have struggled to climb an invisible wall,

												    But if we should climb it, could we ever return?

												    We have known it all, and felt it all

												    Till we can know no more ...

												    Let us climb out and end it, then,

												    Lest it become immortal.

												    Let us climb out and end it, then,

												    Just for the change ...

												    This is the same night, still, and you, and I,

												    Struggling to keep our feet in a chaos of sound.

												    And the same puff of smoke

												    Passes, to leave the same stars in the sky.
											    
												    VI
											    
												  Out there, in the moonlight,

												    How still in the grass they lie,

												    Those who panted beside us, or stumbled before us,

												    Those who yelled like madmen and ran at the sun,

												    Flinging their guns before them.

												    One of them stares all day at the sky

												    As if he had seen some strange thing there,

												    One of them tightly holds his gun

												    As if he dreaded a danger there,

												    One of them stoops above his friend,

												    By moon and sun we see him there.

												    One of them saw white cottage walls

												    With purple clematis flowers and leaves,

												    And heard through trees his waterfalls

												    And whistled under the eaves;

												    One of them walked on yellow sand

												    And watched a young girl gathering shells--

												    Once, a white wave caught her hand ...

												    One of them heard how certain bells

												    Chimed in a valley, mellow and slow,

												    Just as he turned to go ...
											    
												    VII
											    
												  All night long, all night long,

												    We see them and do not remember them,

												    We hear the terrible sounds of guns,

												    We see the white rays darting and darting,

												    We are beaten down and crawl to our feet,

												    We wipe the dirt from mouths and eyes,

												    Dust-coloured animals creeping in dust,

												    Animals stupefied by sound;

												    We are beaten down, and some of us rise,

												    And some become a part of the ground,

												    But what do we care? We never knew them,

												    Or if we did it was long ago ...

												    Night will end in a year or so,

												    We look at each other as if to say,

												    Across the void of time between us,

												    'Will the word come to-day?'



Old Age Poems

#######################################################

As down the frosty road we came,

												    My man and I together,

												    We talked of this, and smiled at that,

												    Nor felt the chilling weather.

												    For side by side we trudged along,

												    Each thought the other sharing,

												    And in each other's company

											    The wintry breezes daring.
												  æ
												  The sky above was cold and gray,

												    The earth below was dreary,

												    But home was near, and love was warm,

												    Altho' the way seemed weary.

												    John had but me, I had but John,

												    Life's twilight skies to brighten,

												    But every sorrow we had borne,

											    Some blessing came to lighten.
												  æ
												  We passed the hillside on our way,

												    Where 'neath the sod were sleeping

												    The four dear children God had spared

												    But shortly to our keeping.

												    We looked that way with wistful eyes,

												    Tear-dimmed with sudden yearning,

												    As backward o'er the lapse of time

											    Our hearts--our thoughts--were turning.
												  æ
												  "Dear soul, cheer up!" John softly said,

												    "They only wait above us!

												    Are we not glad no parting waits

												    Us here for those that love us?"

												    Into his dear old face I looked,

												    No longer then repining:

												    For John had me, and I had John;

											    Love's sunbeams still were shining.
												  æ
										        The summer joys long since were past,

												    And winter's snows were o'er us;

												    The twilight sky was cold and drear,

												    And night was just before us.

												    But though the way so weary seemed,

												    Yet John and I were merry:

												    For said I not that home was near?

												    And hearts and thoughts grew cheery.
										        æ
											    And thinking o'er that walk today--

												    When John and I together,

												    Side close by side, came down the road,

												    All thro' the frosty weather--

												    I think of how, life's journey trod,

												    With trust forsaken never,

												    We've nearly reached at night that home

												    Where dwelleth rest forever.



War Poems

#######################################################

1
											    
												  												    An old man bending I come among new faces,

												    Years looking backward resuming in answer to children,

												    Come tell us old man, as from young men and maidens that love me,

												    (Arous'd and angry, I'd thought to beat the alarum, and urge relentless war,

												    But soon my fingers fail'd me, my face droop'd and I resign'd myself,

												    To sit by the wounded and soothe them, or silently watch the dead;)

												    Years hence of these scenes, of these furious passions, these chances,

												    Of unsurpass'd heroes, (was one side so brave? the other was equally brave;)

												    Now be witness again, paint the mightiest armies of earth,

												    Of those armies so rapid so wondrous what saw you to tell us?

												    What stays with you latest and deepest? of curious panics,

												    Of hard-fought engagements or sieges tremendous what deepest remains?
											    
												     2
											    
												  												    O maidens and young men I love and that love me,

												    What you ask of my days those the strangest and sudden your talking recalls,

												    Soldier alert I arrive after a long march cover'd with sweat and dust,

												    In the nick of time I come, plunge in the fight, loudly shout in the

												    rush of successful charge,

												    Enter the captur'd works--yet lo, like a swift-running river they fade,

												    Pass and are gone they fade--I dwell not on soldiers' perils or

												    soldiers' joys,

												    (Both I remember well--many the hardships, few the joys, yet I was content.)
												  æ
												  But in silence, in dreams' projections,

												    While the world of gain and appearance and mirth goes on,

												    So soon what is over forgotten, and waves wash the imprints off the sand,

												    With hinged knees returning I enter the doors, (while for you up there,

												    Whoever you are, follow without noise and be of strong heart.)
												  æ
												  Bearing the bandages, water and sponge,

												    Straight and swift to my wounded I go,

												    Where they lie on the ground after the battle brought in,

												    Where their priceless blood reddens the grass the ground,

												    Or to the rows of the hospital tent, or under the roof'd hospital,

												    To the long rows of cots up and down each side I return,

												    To each and all one after another I draw near, not one do I miss,

												    An attendant follows holding a tray, he carries a refuse pail,

												    Soon to be fill'd with clotted rags and blood, emptied, and fill'd again.
												  æ
												  I onward go, I stop,

												    With hinged knees and steady hand to dress wounds,

												    I am firm with each, the pangs are sharp yet unavoidable,

												    One turns to me his appealing eyes--poor boy! I never knew you,

												    Yet I think I could not refuse this moment to die for you, if that

												    would save you.
											    
												     3
											    
												  												    On, on I go, (open doors of time! open hospital doors!)

												    The crush'd head I dress, (poor crazed hand tear not the bandage away,)

												    The neck of the cavalry-man with the bullet through and through examine,

												    Hard the breathing rattles, quite glazed already the eye, yet life

												    struggles hard,

												    (Come sweet death! be persuaded O beautiful death!

												    In mercy come quickly.)
												  æ
												  From the stump of the arm, the amputated hand,

												    I undo the clotted lint, remove the slough, wash off the matter and blood,

												    Back on his pillow the soldier bends with curv'd neck and side falling head,

												    His eyes are closed, his face is pale, he dares not look on the

												    bloody stump,

												    And has not yet look'd on it.
												  æ
												  I dress a wound in the side, deep, deep,

												    But a day or two more, for see the frame all wasted and sinking,

												    And the yellow-blue countenance see.
												  æ
												  I dress the perforated shoulder, the foot with the bullet-wound,

												    Cleanse the one with a gnawing and putrid gangrene, so sickening,

												    so offensive,

												    While the attendant stands behind aside me holding the tray and pail.
												  æ
												  I am faithful, I do not give out,

												    The fractur'd thigh, the knee, the wound in the abdomen,

												    These and more I dress with impassive hand, (yet deep in my breast

												    a fire, a burning flame.)
										        
											         4
										        
											      												    Thus in silence in dreams' projections,

												    Returning, resuming, I thread my way through the hospitals,

												    The hurt and wounded I pacify with soothing hand,

												    I sit by the restless all the dark night, some are so young,

												    Some suffer so much, I recall the experience sweet and sad,

												    (Many a soldier's loving arms about this neck have cross'd and rested,

												    Many a soldier's kiss dwells on these bearded lips.)



Death Poems

#######################################################

Undertakers, hearse drivers, grave diggers,

											      I speak to you as one not afraid of your business.
												  æ
												  You handle dust going to a long country,

												    You know the secret behind your job is the same whether you lower the coffin with modern, automatic machinery, well-oiled and noiseless, or whether the body is laid in by naked hands and then covered by the shovels.
												  æ
												  Your day's work is done with laughter many days of the year,

												    And you earn a living by those who say good-by today in thin whispers.

He's gone, and all our plans
   Are useless indeed.
We'll walk no more on Cotswold
   Where the sheep feed
   Quietly and take no heed.
 
His body that was so quick
   Is not as you
Knew it, on Severn river
   Under the blue
   Driving our small boat through.
 
You would not know him now ...
   But still he died
Nobly, so cover him over
   With violets of pride
   Purple from Severn side.
 
Cover him, cover him soon!
   And with thick-set
Masses of memoried flowers
   Hide that red wet
   Thing I must somehow forget.



Love

#######################################################

Making his advances
He does not look at her, nor sniff at her,
No, not even sniff at her, his nose is blank.

Only he senses the vulnerable folds of skin
That work beneath her while she sprawls along
In her ungainly pace,
Her folds of skin that work and row
Beneath the earth-soiled hovel in which she moves.

And so he strains beneath her housey walls
And catches her trouser-legs in his beak
Suddenly, or her skinny limb,
And strange and grimly drags at her
Like a dog,
Only agelessly silent, with a reptile's awful persistency.

Grim, gruesome gallantry, to which he is doomed.
Dragged out of an eternity of silent isolation
And doomed to partiality, partial being,
Ache, and want of being,
Want,
Self-exposure, hard humiliation, need to add himself on to her.

Born to walk alone,
Forerunner,
Now suddenly distracted into this mazy side-track,
This awkward, harrowing pursuit,
This grim necessity from within.

Does she know
As she moves eternally slowly away?
Or is he driven against her with a bang, like a bird flying in the dark against a window,
All knowledgeless?

The awful concussion,
And the still more awful need to persist, to follow, follow, continue,
Driven, after ons of pristine, fore-god-like singleness and oneness,
At the end of some mysterious, red-hot iron,
Driven away from himself into her tracks,
Forced to crash against her.

Stiff, gallant, irascible, crook-legged reptile,
Little gentleman,
Sorry plight,
We ought to look the other way.

Save that, having come with you so far,
We will go on to the end.



Life Poems

About life

												    I started writing a book.

												    Writing the book

Love

#######################################################

With the man I love who loves me not,
I walked in the street-lamps' flare;
We watched the world go home that night
In a flood through Union Square.

I leaned to catch the words he said
That were light as a snowflake falling;
Ah well that he never leaned to hear
The words my heart was calling.

And on we walked and on we walked
Past the fiery lights of the picture shows 
Where the girls with thirsty eyes go by
On the errand each man knows.

And on we walked and on we walked,
At the door at last we said good-bye;
I knew by his smile he had not heard
My heart's unuttered cry.

With the man I love who loves me not
I walked in the street-lamps' flare 
But oh, the girls who ask for love
In the lights of Union Square.

War Poems

Vigil strange I kept on the field one night;

												    When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day,

												    One look I but gave which your dear eyes return'd with a look I

												    shall never forget,

												    One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach'd up as you lay on the ground,

												    Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle,

												    Till late in the night reliev'd to the place at last again I made my way,

												    Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of

												    responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)

												    Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the

												    moderate night-wind,

												    Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the

												    battlefield spreading,

												    Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night,

												    But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed,

												    Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my

												    chin in my hands,

												    Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest

												    comrade--not a tear, not a word,

												    Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my soldier,

												    As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole,

												    Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your death,

												    I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall

												    surely meet again,)

												    Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appear'd,

												    My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop'd well his form,

												    Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and

												    carefully under feet,

												    And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his

												    grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited,

												    Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field dim,

												    Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)

												    Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day

												    brighten'd,

												    I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket,

											      And buried him where he fell.

There is a wolf in me . . . fangs pointed for tearing gashes . . . a red tongue for raw meat . . . and the hot lapping of bloodI keep this wolf because the wilderness gave it to me and the wilderness will not let it go.

Love Poems

With what dull drugs do I conspire to still

												    My heart that cries for you incessantly:

												    Drowned in the clacking keys' monotony,

												    Stabbed by a pen, crushed in the ruthless mill

												    Of sleep and eat and work and eat, until

												    I seem almost to have the mastery

												    Of my fierce want, and you become to me

											      An image lost like sun behind a hill.
												  æ
										        One note of music's delicate suspense,

												    A lilac cloud ending my avenue,

												    A child's brown hand, a lover's voice, a verse,

												    Wrecks suddenly my slowly wrought defense,

												    And once again I face my dearest curse,

												    The priceless agony of wanting you.
