An' she answe'd, "'Cose I do"
Jump back, honey, jump back.



Historical Poems

#######################################################

He became King of England in 1761, 

												    a sickly young man 

												    from German stock. 

												    

												    He charged taxes 

												    to the English 

												    who were trying to set up camp 

												    in a new country 

												    across the sea, soon to be called America. 

												    

												    The Americans, 

												    as the history books tell us, 

												    eventually refused; 

												    and then other colonies followed; 

												    and soon the King lost control. 

												    

												    He couldnäó»t get over the fact 

												    that theyäó»d stepped over his authority. 

												    He was naí¿ve. 

												    He didnäó»t realize, 

												    by asking these rebellious Englishman 

												    to pay him taxes, he was insulting their courage. 

												    

												    These people, 

												    these soon-to-be Americans 

												    had found a new world. 

												    Theyäó»d endured months at sea. 

												    Theyäó»d endured sickness and death 

												    and native Indian hostility 

												    and attacks. 

												    Theyäó»d endured blizzards 

												    and frost bite and total starvation. 

												    They had pioneered their way into establishing 

												    an entirely new way of living, 

												    realizing what it felt like to be free, 

												    roaming on a land 

												    savage 

												    as the charging buffalo; 

												    and yet this King, 

												    foolish like a father 

												    telling his son what to do 

												    after heäó»d moved out of the house 

												    surviving on his own for years, 

												    decided to try and lay down the whip 

												    by taxing for tea 

												    and other bullshit items 

												    the Americans had already figured out 

												    how to acquire on their own. 

												    

												    And so the American Revolution began 

												    while King George 

												    suffered from a hereditary disease 

												    called porphyria, which causes 

												    an insufficient production of hemoglobin. 

												    He couldnäó»t stand too long in the sun. 

												    He had port-wine-colored skin. 

												    He had paralysis in his arms and legs. 

												    He had interruptions of nerve impulses, 

												    which caused him psychiatric problems. 

												    Almost ten years, from 1811-1820, 

												    his insanity progressed. 

												    He spent his time in isolation, 

												    often in straight jackets 

												    and behind bars in his private 

												    apartments at Windsor Castle. 

												    

												    He was a crazed, debilitated soul. 

												    

												    His craziness is a symbol of Europeäó»s naí¿ve attempt 

												    to control an uncivilized world. 

												    

												    His craziness 

												    is now the craziness 

												    of America, 250 years later. 

												    

												    You can see him 

												    in the eyes of a man in a suit 

												    while he walks across the human aquarium 

												    of Times Square. 

												    

												    You can see his craziness in an oil tycoon. 

												    

												    You can see his craziness in almost every President 

												    of the United States. 

												    

												    You can see his craziness teaching history 

												    in Long Beach, California. 

												    

												    You can see his craziness in a dentistäó»s smile. 

												    You can see his craziness in India and China 

												    and Russia and where ever the dollar is passed 

												    from hand to hand. 

												    

												    Please, someone finally take the crown 

												    off this fuckeräó»s head 

												    and call him 

												    for what he truly is: . . . 

												    

												    a diseased 

												    and greedy 

											      little boy.



Death Poems

#######################################################

Listen, children:

												    Your father is dead.

												    From his old coats

												    I'll make you little jackets;

												    I'll make you little trousers

												    From his old pants.

												    There'll be in his pockets

												    Things he used to put there,

												    Keys and pennies

												    Covered with tobacco;

												    Dan shall have the pennies

												    To save in his bank;

												    Anne shall have the keys

												    To make a pretty noise with.

Life must go on,

												    And the dead be forgotten;

												    Life must go on,

												    Though good men die;

												    Anne, eat your breakfast;

												    Dan, take your medicine;

												    Life must go on;

											      I forget just why.



Dramatic Poems

#######################################################

The lawyer, are you?

												    Well!  I ain't got nothin' to say.

												    Nothin'!

												    I told the perlice I hadn't nothin'.

												    They know'd real well 'twas me.

												    Ther warn't no supposin',

												    Ketchin' me in the woods as they did,

												    An' me in my house dress.

												    Folks don't walk miles an' miles

												    In the drifted snow,

												    With no hat nor wrap on 'em

												    Ef everythin's all right, I guess.

												    All right?  Ha!  Ha!  Ha!

												    Nothin' warn't right with me.

												    Never was.

												    Oh, Lord!  Why did I do it?

												    Why ain't it yesterday, and Ed here agin?

												    Many's the time I've set up with him nights

												    When he had cramps, or rheumatizm, or somethin'.

												    I used ter nurse him same's ef he was a baby.

												    I wouldn't hurt him, I love him!

												    Don't you dare to say I killed him.  'Twarn't me!

												    Somethin' got aholt o' me.  I couldn't help it.

												    Oh, what shall I do!  What shall I do!

												    Yes, Sir.

												    No, Sir.

												    I beg your pardon, I -- I --

												    Oh, I'm a wicked woman!

												    An' I'm desolate, desolate!

												    Why warn't I struck dead or paralyzed

												    Afore my hands done it.

												    Oh, my God, what shall I do!

												    No, Sir, ther ain't no extenuatin' circumstances,

												    An' I don't want none.

												    I want a bolt o' lightnin'

												    To strike me dead right now!

												    Oh, I'll tell yer.

												    But it won't make no diff'rence.

												    Nothin' will.

												    Yes, I killed him.

												    Why do yer make me say it?

												    It's cruel!  Cruel!

												    I killed him because o' th' silence.

												    The long, long silence,

												    That watched all around me,

												    And he wouldn't break it.

												    I tried to make him,

												    Time an' agin,

												    But he was terrible taciturn, Ed was.

												    He never spoke 'cept when he had to,

												    An' then he'd only say "yes" and "no".

												    You can't even guess what that silence was.

												    I'd hear it whisperin' in my ears,

												    An' I got frightened, 'twas so thick,

												    An' al'ays comin' back.

												    Ef Ed would ha' talked sometimes

												    It would ha' driven it away;

												    But he never would.

												    He didn't hear it same as I did.

												    You see, Sir,

												    Our farm was off'n the main road,

												    And set away back under the mountain;

												    And the village was seven mile off,

												    Measurin' after you'd got out o' our lane.

												    We didn't have no hired man,

												    'Cept in hayin' time;

												    An' Dane's place,

												    That was the nearest,

												    Was clear way 'tother side the mountain.

												    They used Marley post-office

												    An' ours was Benton.

												    Ther was a cart-track took yer to Dane's in Summer,

												    An' it warn't above two mile that way,

												    But it warn't never broke out Winters.

												    I used to dread the Winters.

												    Seem's ef I couldn't abear to see the golden-rod bloomin';

												    Winter'd come so quick after that.

												    You don't know what snow's like when yer with it

												    Day in an' day out.

												    Ed would be out all day loggin',

												    An' I set at home and look at the snow

												    Layin' over everythin';

												    It 'ud dazzle me blind,

												    Till it warn't white any more, but black as ink.

												    Then the quiet 'ud commence rushin' past my ears

												    Till I most went mad listenin' to it.

												    Many's the time I've dropped a pan on the floor

												    Jest to hear it clatter.

												    I was most frantic when dinner-time come

												    An' Ed was back from the woods.

												    I'd ha' give my soul to hear him speak.

												    But he'd never say a word till I asked him

												    Did he like the raised biscuits or whatever,

												    An' then sometimes he'd jest nod his answer.

												    Then he'd go out agin,

												    An' I'd watch him from the kitchin winder.

												    It seemed the woods come marchin' out to meet him

												    An' the trees 'ud press round him an' hustle him.

												    I got so I was scared o' th' trees.

												    I thought they come nearer,

												    Every day a little nearer,

												    Closin' up round the house.

												    I never went in t' th' woods Winters,

												    Though in Summer I liked 'em well enough.

												    It warn't so bad when my little boy was with us.

												    He used to go sleddin' and skatin',

												    An' every day his father fetched him to school in the pung

												    An' brought him back agin.

												    We scraped an' scraped fer Neddy,

												    We wanted him to have a education.

												    We sent him to High School,

												    An' then he went up to Boston to Technology.

												    He was a minin' engineer,

												    An' doin' real well,

												    A credit to his bringin' up.

												    But his very first position ther was an explosion in the mine.

												    And I'm glad!  I'm glad!

												    He ain't here to see me now.

												    Neddy!  Neddy!

												    I'm your mother still, Neddy.

												    Don't turn from me like that.

												    I can't abear it.  I can't!  I can't!

												    What did you say?

												    Oh, yes, Sir.

												    I'm here.

												    I'm very sorry,

												    I don't know what I'm sayin'.

												    No, Sir,

												    Not till after Neddy died.

												    'Twas the next Winter the silence come,

												    I don't remember noticin' it afore.

												    That was five year ago,

												    An' it's been gittin' worse an' worse.

												    I asked Ed to put in a telephone.

												    I thought ef I felt the whisperin' comin' on

												    I could ring up some o' th' folks.

												    But Ed wouldn't hear of it.

												    He said we'd paid so much for Neddy

												    We couldn't hardly git along as 'twas.

												    An' he never understood me wantin' to talk.

												    Well, this year was worse'n all the others;

												    We had a terrible spell o' stormy weather,

												    An' the snow lay so thick

												    You couldn't see the fences even.

												    Out o' doors was as flat as the palm o' my hand,

												    Ther warn't a hump or a holler

												    Fer as you could see.

												    It was so quiet

												    The snappin' o' the branches back in the wood-lot

												    Sounded like pistol shots.

												    Ed was out all day

												    Same as usual.

												    An' it seemed he talked less'n ever.

												    He didn't even say `Good-mornin'', once or twice,

												    An' jest nodded or shook his head when I asked him things.

												    On Monday he said he'd got to go over to Benton

												    Fer some oats.

												    I'd oughter ha' gone with him,

												    But 'twas washin' day

												    An' I was afeared the fine weather'd break,

												    An' I couldn't do my dryin'.

												    All my life I'd done my work punctual,

												    An' I couldn't fix my conscience

												    To go junketin' on a washin'-day.

												    I can't tell you what that day was to me.

												    It dragged an' dragged,

												    Fer ther warn't no Ed ter break it in the middle

												    Fer dinner.

												    Every time I stopped stirrin' the water

												    I heerd the whisperin' all about me.

												    I stopped oftener'n I should

												    To see ef 'twas still ther,

												    An' it al'ays was.

												    An' gittin' louder

												    It seemed ter me.

												    Once I threw up the winder to feel the wind.

												    That seemed most alive somehow.

												    But the woods looked so kind of menacin'

												    I closed it quick

												    An' started to mangle's hard's I could,

												    The squeakin' was comfortin'.

												    Well, Ed come home 'bout four.

												    I seen him down the road,

												    An' I run out through the shed inter th' barn

												    To meet him quicker.

												    I hollered out, `Hullo!'

												    But he didn't say nothin',

												    He jest drove right in

												    An' climbed out o' th' sleigh

												    An' commenced unharnessin'.

												    I asked him a heap o' questions;

												    Who he'd seed

												    An' what he'd done.

												    Once in a while he'd nod or shake,

												    But most o' th' time he didn't do nothin'.

												    'Twas gittin' dark then,

												    An' I was in a state,

												    With the loneliness

												    An' Ed payin' no attention

												    Like somethin' warn't livin'.

												    All of a sudden it come,

												    I don't know what,

												    But I jest couldn't stand no more.

												    It didn't seem 's though that was Ed,

												    An' it didn't seem as though I was me.

												    I had to break a way out somehow,

												    Somethin' was closin' in

												    An' I was stiflin'.

												    Ed's loggin' axe was ther,

												    An' I took it.

												    Oh, my God!

												    I can't see nothin' else afore me all the time.

												    I run out inter th' woods,

												    Seemed as ef they was pullin' me;

												    An' all the time I was wadin' through the snow

												    I seed Ed in front of me

												    Where I'd laid him.

												    An' I see him now.

												    There!  There!

												    What you holdin' me fer?

												    I want ter go to Ed,

												    He's bleedin'.

												    Stop holdin' me.

												    I got to go.

												    I'm comin', Ed.

												    I'll be ther in a minit.

												    Oh, I'm so tired!

Dramatic Poems

#######################################################

Good ev'nin', Mis' Priest.

												    I jest stepped in to tell you Good-bye.

												    Yes, it's all over.

												    All my things is packed

												    An' every last one o' them boxes

												    Is on Bradley's team

												    Bein' hauled over to th' depot.

												    No, I ain't goin' back agin.

												    I'm stoppin' over to French's fer to-night,

												    And goin' down first train in th' mornin'.

												    Yes, it do seem kinder queer

												    Not to be goin' to see Cherry's Orchard no more,

												    But Land Sakes!  When a change's comin',

												    Why, I al'ays say it can't come too quick.

												    Now, that's real kind o' you,

												    Your doughnuts is always so tasty.

												    Yes, I'm goin' to Chicago,

												    To my niece,

												    She's married to a fine man, hardware business,

												    An' doin' real well, she tells me.

												    Lizzie's be'n at me to go out ther for the longest while.

												    She ain't got no kith nor kin to Chicago, you know

												    She's rented me a real nice little flat,

												    Same house as hers,

												    An' I'm goin' to try that city livin' folks say's so pleasant.

												    Oh, yes, he was real generous,

												    Paid me a sight o' money fer the Orchard;

												    I told him 'twouldn't yield nothin' but stones,

												    But he ain't farmin' it.

												    Lor', no, Mis' Priest,

												    He's jest took it to set and look at the view.

												    Mebbe he wouldn't be so stuck on the view

												    Ef he'd seed it every mornin' and night for forty year

												    Same's as I have.

												    I dessay it's pretty enough,

												    But it's so pressed into me

												    I c'n see't with my eyes shut.

												    No.  I ain't cold, Mis' Priest,

												    Don't shut th' door.

												    I'll be all right in a minit.

												    But I ain't a mite sorry to leave that view.

												    Well, mebbe 'tis queer to feel so,

												    An' mebbe 'taint.

												    My!  But that tea's revivin'.

												    Old things ain't always pleasant things, Mis' Priest.

												    No, no, I don't cal'late on comin' back,

												    That's why I'd ruther be to Chicago,

												    Boston's too near.

												    It ain't cold, Mis' Priest,

												    It's jest my thoughts.

												    I ain't sick, only --

												    Mis' Priest, ef you've nothin' ter take yer time,

												    An' have a mind to listen,

												    Ther's somethin' I'd like ter speak about

												    I ain't never mentioned it,

												    But I'd like to tell yer 'fore I go.

												    Would you mind lowerin' them shades,

												    Fall twilight's awful grey,

												    An' that fire's real cosy with the shades drawed.

												    Well, I guess folks about here think I've be'n dret'ful onsociable.

												    You needn't say 'taint so, 'cause I know diff'rent.

												    An' what's more, it's true.

												    Well, the reason is I've be'n scared out o' my life.

												    Scared ev'ry minit o' th' time, fer eight year.

												    Eight mortal year 'tis, come next June.

												    'Twas on the eighteenth o' June,

												    Six months after I'd buried my husband,

												    That somethin' happened ter me.

												    Mebbe you'll mind that afore that

												    I was a cheery body.

												    Hiram was too,

												    Al'ays liked to ask a neighbor in,

												    An' ev'n when he died,

												    Barrin' low sperrits, I warn't averse to seein' nobody.

												    But that eighteenth o' June changed ev'rythin'.

												    I was doin' most o' th' farmwork myself,

												    With jest a hired boy, Clarence King, 'twas,

												    Comin' in fer an hour or two.

												    Well, that eighteenth o' June

												    I was goin' round,

												    Lockin' up and seein' to things 'fore I went to bed.

												    I was jest steppin' out t' th' barn,

												    Goin' round outside 'stead o' through the shed,

												    'Cause there was such a sight o' moonlight

												    Somehow or another I thought 'twould be pretty outdoors.

												    I got settled for pretty things that night, I guess.

												    I ain't stuck on 'em no more.

												    Well, them laylock bushes side o' th' house

												    Was real lovely.

												    Glitt'rin' and shakin' in the moonlight,

												    An' the smell o' them rose right up

												    An' most took my breath away.

												    The colour o' the spikes was all faded out,

												    They never keep their colour when the moon's on 'em,

												    But the smell fair 'toxicated me.

												    I was al'ays partial to a sweet scent,

												    An' I went close up t' th' bushes

												    So's to put my face right into a flower.

												    Mis' Priest, jest's I got breathin' in that laylock bloom

												    I saw, layin' right at my feet,

												    A man's hand!

												    It was as white's the side o' th' house,

												    And sparklin' like that lum'nous paint they put on gate-posts.

												    I screamed right out,

												    I couldn't help it,

												    An' I could hear my scream

												    Goin' over an' over

												    In that echo be'ind th' barn.

												    Hearin' it agin an' agin like that

												    Scared me so, I dar'sn't scream any more.

												    I jest stood ther,

												    And looked at that hand.

												    I thought the echo'd begin to hammer like my heart,

												    But it didn't.

												    There was only th' wind,

												    Sighin' through the laylock leaves,

												    An' slappin' 'em up agin the house.

												    Well, I guess I looked at that hand

												    Most ten minits,

												    An' it never moved,

												    Jest lay there white as white.

												    After a while I got to thinkin' that o' course

												    'Twas some drunken tramp over from Redfield.

												    That calmed me some,

												    An' I commenced to think I'd better git him out

												    From under them laylocks.

												    I planned to drag him in t' th' barn

												    An' lock him in ther till Clarence come in th' mornin'.

												    I got so mad thinkin' o' that all-fired brazen tramp

												    Asleep in my laylocks,

												    I jest stooped down and grabbed th' hand and give it an awful pull.

												    Then I bumped right down settin' on the ground.

												    Mis' Priest, ther warn't no body come with the hand.

												    No, it ain't cold, it's jest that I can't abear thinkin' of it,

												    Ev'n now.

												    I'll take a sip o' tea.

												    Thank you, Mis' Priest, that's better.

												    I'd ruther finish now I've begun.

												    Thank you, jest the same.

												    I dropped the hand's ef it'd be'n red hot

												    'Stead o' ice cold.

												    Fer a minit or two I jest laid on that grass

												    Pantin'.

												    Then I up and run to them laylocks

												    An' pulled 'em every which way.

												    True es I'm settin' here, Mis' Priest,

												    Ther warn't nothin' ther.

												    I peeked an' pryed all about 'em,

												    But ther warn't no man ther

												    Neither livin' nor dead.

												    But the hand was ther all right,

												    Upside down, the way I'd dropped it,

												    And glist'nin' fit to dazzle yer.

												    I don't know how I done it,

												    An' I don't know why I done it,

												    But I wanted to git that dret'ful hand out o' sight

												    I got in t' th' barn, somehow,

												    An' felt roun' till I got a spade.

												    I couldn't stop fer a lantern,

												    Besides, the moonlight was bright enough in all conscience.

												    Then I scooped that awful thing up in th' spade.

												    I had a sight o' trouble doin' it.

												    It slid off, and tipped over, and I couldn't bear

												    Ev'n to touch it with my foot to prop it,

												    But I done it somehow.

												    Then I carried it off be'ind the barn,

												    Clost to an old apple-tree

												    Where you couldn't see from the house,

												    An' I buried it,

											      Good an' deep.
												  I don't rec'lect nothin' more o' that night.

												    Clarence woke me up in th' mornin',

												    Hollerin' fer me to come down and set th' milk.

												    When he'd gone,

												    I stole roun' to the apple-tree

												    And seed the earth all new turned

												    Where I left it in my hurry.

												    I did a heap o' gardenin'

												    That mornin'.

												    I couldn't cut no big sods

												    Fear Clarence would notice and ask me what I wanted 'em fer,

												    So I got teeny bits o' turf here and ther,

												    And no one couldn't tell ther'd be'n any diggin'

												    When I got through.

												    They was awful days after that, Mis' Priest,

												    I used ter go every mornin' and poke about them bushes,

												    An' up and down the fence,

												    Ter find the body that hand come off of.

												    But I couldn't never find nothin'.

												    I'd lay awake nights

												    Hearin' them laylocks blowin' and whiskin'.

												    At last I had Clarence cut 'em down

												    An' make a big bonfire of 'em.

												    I told him the smell made me sick,

												    An' that warn't no lie,

												    I can't abear the smell on 'em now;

												    An' no wonder, es you say.

												    I fretted somethin' awful 'bout that hand

												    I wondered, could it be Hiram's,

												    But folks don't rob graveyards hereabouts.

												    Besides, Hiram's hands warn't that awful, starin' white.

												    I give up seein' people,

												    I was afeared I'd say somethin'.

												    You know what folks thought o' me

												    Better'n I do, I dessay,

												    But mebbe now you'll see I couldn't do nothin' diff'rent.

												    But I stuck it out,

												    I warn't goin' to be downed

												    By no loose hand, no matter how it come ther

												    But that ain't the worst, Mis' Priest,

												    Not by a long ways.

												    Two year ago, Mr. Densmore made me an offer for Cherry's Orchard.

												    Well, I'd got used to th' thought o' bein' sort o' blighted,

												    An' I warn't scared no more.

												    Lived down my fear, I guess.

												    I'd kinder got used to th' thought o' that awful night,

												    And I didn't mope much about it.

												    Only I never went out o' doors by moonlight;

												    That stuck.

												    Well, when Mr. Densmore's offer come,

												    I started thinkin' 'bout the place

												    An' all the things that had gone on ther.

												    Thinks I, I guess I'll go and see where I put the hand.

												    I was foolhardy with the long time that had gone by.

												    I know'd the place real well,

												    Fer I'd put it right in between two o' the apple roots.

												    I don't know what possessed me, Mis' Priest,

												    But I kinder wanted to know

												    That the hand had been flesh and bone, anyway.

												    It had sorter bothered me, thinkin' I might ha' imagined it.

												    I took a mornin' when the sun was real pleasant and warm;

												    I guessed I wouldn't jump for a few old bones.

												    But I did jump, somethin' wicked.

												    Ther warn't no bones!

												    Ther warn't nothin'!

												    Not ev'n the gold ring I'd minded bein' on the little finger.

												    I don't know ef ther ever was anythin'.

												    I've worried myself sick over it.

												    I be'n diggin' and diggin' day in and day out

												    Till Clarence ketched me at it.

												    Oh, I know'd real well what you all thought,

												    An' I ain't sayin' you're not right,

												    But I ain't goin' to end in no county 'sylum

												    If I c'n help it.

												    The shiv'rin' fits come on me sudden like.

												    I know 'em, don't you trouble.

												    I've fretted considerable about the 'sylum,

												    I guess I be'n frettin' all the time I ain't be'n diggin'.

												    But anyhow I can't dig to Chicago, can I?

												    Thank you, Mis' Priest,

												    I'm better now.  I only dropped in in passin'.

												    I'll jest be steppin' along down to French's.

												    No, I won't be seein' nobody in the mornin',

												    It's a pretty early start.

												    Don't you stand ther, Mis' Priest,

												    The wind'll blow yer lamp out,

												    An' I c'n see easy, I got aholt o' the gate now.

												    I ain't a mite tired, thank you.

											    Good-night.



Narrative Poems

To drive Paul out of any lumber camp

												    All that was needed was to say to him,

"How is the wife, Paul?"--and he'd disappear.

												    Some said it was because be bad no wife,

												    And hated to be twitted on the subject;

												    Others because he'd come within a day

												    Or so of having one, and then been Jilted;

												    Others because he'd had one once, a good one,

												    Who'd run away with someone else and left him;

												    And others still because he had one now

												    He only had to be reminded of--

												    He was all duty to her in a minute:

												    He had to run right off to look her up,

												    As if to say, "That's so, how is my wife?

												    I hope she isn't getting into mischief."

												    No one was anxious to get rid of Paul.

												    He'd been the hero of the mountain camps

												    Ever since, just to show them, he had slipped

												    The bark of a whole tamarack off whole

												    As clean as boys do off a willow twig

												    To make a willow whistle on a Sunday

												    April by subsiding meadow brooks.

												    They seemed to ask him just to see him go,

"How is the wife, Paul?" and he always went.

												    He never stopped to murder anyone

												    Who asked the question. He just disappeared--

												    Nobody knew in what direction,

												    Although it wasn't usually long

												    Before they heard of him in some new camp,

												    The same Paul at the same old feats of logging.

												    The question everywhere was why should Paul

												    Object to being asked a civil question--

												    A man you could say almost anything to

												    Short of a fighting word. You have the answers.

												    And there was one more not so fair to Paul:

												    That Paul had married a wife not his equal.

												    Paul was ashamed of her. To match a hero

												    She would have had to be a heroine;

												    Instead of which she was some half-breed squaw.

												    But if the story Murphy told was true,

											      She wasn't anything to be ashamed of.
												  æ
												  You know Paul could do wonders. Everyone's

												    Heard how he thrashed the horses on a load

												    That wouldn't budge, until they simply stretched

												    Their rawhide harness from the load to camp.

												    Paul told the boss the load would be all right,

												    "The sun will bring your load in"--and it did--

												    By shrinking the rawhide to natural length.

												    That's what is called a stretcher. But I guess

												    The one about his jumping so's to land

												    With both his feet at once against the ceiling,

												    And then land safely right side up again,

												    Back on the floor, is fact or pretty near fact.

												    Well, this is such a yarn. Paul sawed his wife

												    Out of a white-pine log. Murphy was there

												    And, as you might say, saw the lady born.

												    Paul worked at anything in lumbering.

												    He'd been hard at it taking boards away

												    For--I forget--the last ambitious sawyer

												    To want to find out if he couldn't pile

												    The lumber on Paul till Paul begged for mercy.

												    They'd sliced the first slab off a big butt log,

												    And the sawyer had slammed the carriage back

												    To slam end-on again against the saw teeth.

												    To judge them by the way they caught themselves

												    When they saw what had happened to the log,

												    They must have had a guilty expectation

												    Something was going to go with their slambanging.

												    Something had left a broad black streak of grease

												    On the new wood the whole length of the log

												    Except, perhaps, a foot at either end.

												    But when Paul put his finger in the grease,

												    It wasn't grease at all, but a long slot.

												    The log was hollow. They were sawing pine.

												    "First time I ever saw a hollow pine.

												    That comes of having Paul around the place.

												    Take it to bell for me," the sawyer said.

												    Everyone had to have a look at it

												    And tell Paul what he ought to do about it.

												    (They treated it as his.) "You take a jackknife,

												    And spread the opening, and you've got a dugout

												    All dug to go a-fishing in." To Paul

												    The hollow looked too sound and clean and empty

												    Ever to have housed birds or beasts or bees.

												    There was no entrance for them to get in by.

												    It looked to him like some new kind of hollow

												    He thought he'd better take his jackknife to.

												    So after work that evening be came back

												    And let enough light into it by cutting

												    To see if it was empty. He made out in there

												    A slender length of pith, or was it pith?

												    It might have been the skin a snake had cast

												    And left stood up on end inside the tree

												    The hundred years the tree must have been growing.

												    More cutting and he had this in both hands,

												    And looking from it to the pond nearby,

												    Paul wondered how it would respond to water.

												    Not a breeze stirred, but just the breath of air

												    He made in walking slowly to the beach

												    Blew it once off his hands and almost broke it.

												    He laid it at the edge, where it could drink.

												    At the first drink it rustled and grew limp.

												    At the next drink it grew invisible.

												    Paul dragged the shallows for it with his fingers,

												    And thought it must have melted. It was gone.

												    And then beyond the open water, dim with midges,

												    Where the log drive lay pressed against the boom,

												    It slowly rose a person, rose a girl,

												    Her wet hair heavy on her like a helmet,

												    Who, leaning on a log, looked back at Paul.

												    And that made Paul in turn look back

												    To see if it was anyone behind him

												    That she was looking at instead of him.

												    (Murphy had been there watching all the time,

												    But from a shed where neither of them could see him.)

												    There was a moment of suspense in birth

												    When the girl seemed too waterlogged to live,

												    Before she caught her first breath with a gasp

												    And laughed. Then she climbed slowly to her feet,

												    And walked off, talking to herself or Paul,

												    Across the logs like backs of alligators,

												    Paul taking after her around the pond.
												  æ
												  Next evening Murphy and some other fellows

												    Got drunk, and tracked the pair up Catamount,

												    From the bare top of which there is a view

												    To other hills across a kettle valley.

												    And there, well after dark, let Murphy tell it,

												    They saw Paul and his creature keeping house.

												    It was the only glimpse that anyone

												    Has had of Paul and her since Murphy saw them

												    Falling in love across the twilight millpond.

												    More than a mile across the wilderness

												    They sat together halfway up a cliff

												    In a small niche let into it, the girl

												    Brightly, as if a star played on the place,

												    Paul darkly, like her shadow. All the light

												    Was from the girl herself, though, not from a star,

												    As was apparent from what happened next.

												    All those great ruffians put their throats together,

												    And let out a loud yell, and threw a bottle,

												    As a brute tribute of respect to beauty.

												    Of course the bottle fell short by a mile,

												    But the shout reached the girl and put her light out.

												    She went out like a firefly, and that was all.
												  æ
												  So there were witnesses that Paul was married

												    And not to anyone to be ashamed of

												    Everyone had been wrong in judging Paul.

												    Murphy told me Paul put on all those airs

												    About his wife to keep her to himself.

												    Paul was what's called a terrible possessor.

												    Owning a wife with him meant owning her.

												    She wasn't anybody else's business,

												    Either to praise her or much as name her,

												    And he'd thank people not to think of her.

												    Murphy's idea was that a man like Paul

												    Wouldn't be spoken to about a wife

											    In any way the world knew how to speak.

Nothing to say to all those marriages!

												    She had made three herself to three of his.

												    The score was even for them, three to three.

												    But come to die she found she cared so much:

												    She thought of children in a burial row;

												    Three children in a burial row were sad.

												    One man's three women in a burial row

												    Somehow made her impatient with the man.

												    And so she said to Laban, "You have done

												    A good deal right; don't do the last thing wrong.

											      Don't make me lie with those two other women."
												  æ
												  Laban said, No, he would not make her lie

												    With anyone but that she had a mind to,

												    If that was how she felt, of course, he said.

												    She went her way. But Laban having caught

												    This glimpse of lingering person in Eliza,

												    And anxious to make all he could of it

												    With something he remembered in himself,

												    Tried to think how he could exceed his promise,

												    And give good measure to the dead, though thankless.

												    If that was how she felt, he kept repeating.

												    His first thought under pressure was a grave

												    In a new boughten grave plot by herself,

												    Under he didn't care how great a stone:

												    He'd sell a yoke of steers to pay for it.

												    And weren't there special cemetery flowers,

												    That, once grief sets to growing, grief may rest;

												    The flowers will go on with grief awhile,

												    And no one seem neglecting or neglected?

												    A prudent grief will not despise such aids.

												    He thought of evergreen and everlasting.

												    And then he had a thought worth many of these.

												    Somewhere must be the grave of the young boy

												    Who married her for playmate more than helpmate,

												    And sometimes laughed at what it was between them.

												    How would she like to sleep her last with him?

												    Where was his grave? Did Laban know his name?
												  æ
												  He found the grave a town or two away,

												    The headstone cut with John, Beloved Husband,

												    Beside it room reserved; the say a sister's;

												    A never-married sister's of that husband,

												    Whether Eliza would be welcome there.

												    The dead was bound to silence: ask the sister.

												    So Laban saw the sister, and, saying nothing

												    Of where Eliza wanted not to lie,

												    And who had thought to lay her with her first love,

												    Begged simply for the grave. The sister's face

												    Fell all in wrinkles of responsibility.

												    She wanted to do right. She'd have to think.

												    Laban was old and poor, yet seemed to care;

												    And she was old and poor--but she cared, too.

												    They sat. She cast one dull, old look at him,

												    Then turned him out to go on other errands

												    She said he might attend to in the village,

												    While she made up her mind how much she cared--

												    And how much Laban cared--and why he cared,

												    (She made shrewd eyes to see where he came in.)
												  æ
												  She'd looked Eliza up her second time,

												    A widow at her second husband's grave,

												    And offered her a home to rest awhile

												    Before she went the poor man's widow's way,

												    Housekeeping for the next man out of wedlock.

												    She and Eliza had been friends through all.

												    Who was she to judge marriage in a world

												    Whose Bible's so confused up in marriage counsel?

												    The sister had not come across this Laban;

												    A decent product of life's ironing-out;

												    She must not keep him waiting. Time would press

												    Between the death day and the funeral day.

												    So when she saw him coming in the street

												    She hurried her decision to be ready

												    To meet him with his answer at the door.

												    Laban had known about what it would be

												    From the way she had set her poor old mouth,

												    To do, as she had put it, what was right.
												  æ
												  She gave it through the screen door closed between them:

												    "No, not with John. There wouldn't be no sense.

												    Eliza's had too many other men."
												  æ
												  Laban was forced to fall back on his plan

												    To buy Eliza a plot to lie alone in:

												    Which gives him for himself a choice of lots

											    When his time comes to die and settle down.



War Poems

#######################################################

Ten minutes now I have been looking at this.

												    I have gone by here before and wondered about it.

												    This is a bronze memorial of a famous general

												    Riding horseback with a flag and a sword and a revolver on him.

												    I want to smash the whole thing into a pile of junk to be hauled away to the scrap yard.

												    I put it straight to you,

												    After the farmer, the miner, the shop man, the factory hand, the fireman and the teamster,

												    Have all been remembered with bronze memorials,

												    Shaping them on the job of getting all of us

												    Something to eat and something to wear,

												    When they stack a few silhouettes

												    Against the sky

												    Here in the park,

												    And show the real huskies that are doing the work of the world, and feeding people instead of butchering them,

												    Then maybe I will stand here

												    And look easy at this general of the army holding a flag in the air,

												    And riding like hell on horseback

												    Ready to kill anybody that gets in his way,

												    Ready to run the red blood and slush the bowels of men all over the sweet new grass of the prairie.



Dramatic Poems

You want to know what's the matter with me, do yer?

												    My! ain't men blinder'n moles?

												    It ain't nothin' new, be sure o' that.

												    Why, ef you'd had eyes you'd ha' seed

												    Me changin' under your very nose,

												    Each day a little diff'rent.

												    But you never see nothin', you don't.

												    Don't touch me, Jake,

												    Don't you dars't to touch me,

												    I ain't in no humour.

												    That's what's come over me;

												    Jest a change clear through.

												    You lay still, an' I'll tell yer,

												    I've had it on my mind to tell yer

												    Fer some time.

												    It's a strain livin' a lie from mornin' till night,

												    An' I'm goin' to put an end to it right now.

												    An' don't make any mistake about one thing,

												    When I married yer I loved yer.

												    Why, your voice 'ud make

												    Me go hot and cold all over,

												    An' your kisses most stopped my heart from beatin'.

												    Lord!  I was a silly fool.

												    But that's the way 'twas.

												    Well, I married yer

												    An' thought Heav'n was comin'

												    To set on the door-step.

												    Heav'n didn't do no settin',

												    Though the first year warn't so bad.

												    The baby's fever threw you off some, I guess,

												    An' then I took her death real hard,

												    An' a mopey wife kind o' disgusts a man.

												    I ain't blamin' yer exactly.

												    But that's how 'twas.

												    Do lay quiet,

												    I know I'm slow, but it's harder to say 'n I thought.

												    There come a time when I got to be

												    More wife agin than mother.

												    The mother part was sort of a waste

												    When we didn't have no other child.

												    But you'd got used ter lots o' things,

												    An' you was all took up with the farm.

												    Many's the time I've laid awake

												    Watchin' the moon go clear through the elm-tree,

												    Out o' sight.

												    I'd foller yer around like a dog,

												    An' set in the chair you'd be'n settin' in,

												    Jest to feel its arms around me,

												    So long's I didn't have yours.

												    It preyed on me, I guess,

												    Longin' and longin'

												    While you was busy all day, and snorin' all night.

												    Yes, I know you're wide awake now,

												    But now ain't then,

												    An' I guess you'll think diff'rent

												    When I'm done.

												    Do you mind the day you went to Hadrock?

												    I didn't want to stay home for reasons,

												    But you said someone 'd have to be here

												    'Cause Elmer was comin' to see t' th' telephone.

												    An' you never see why I was so set on goin' with yer,

												    Our married life hadn't be'n any great shakes,

												    Still marriage is marriage, an' I was raised God-fearin'.

												    But, Lord, you didn't notice nothin',

												    An' Elmer hangin' around all Winter!

												    'Twas a lovely mornin'.

												    The apple-trees was jest elegant

												    With their blossoms all flared out,

												    An' there warn't a cloud in the sky.

												    You went, you wouldn't pay no 'tention to what I said,

												    An' I heard the Ford chuggin' for most a mile,

												    The air was so still.

												    Then Elmer come.

												    It's no use your frettin', Jake,

												    I'll tell you all about it.

												    I know what I'm doin',

												    An' what's worse, I know what I done.

												    Elmer fixed th' telephone in about two minits,

												    An' he didn't seem in no hurry to go,

												    An' I don't know as I wanted him to go either,

												    I was awful mad at your not takin' me with yer,

												    An' I was tired o' wishin' and wishin'

												    An' gittin' no comfort.

												    I guess it ain't necessary to tell yer all the things.

												    He stayed to dinner,

												    An' he helped me do the dishes,

												    An' he said a home was a fine thing,

												    An' I said dishes warn't a home

												    Nor yet the room they're in.

												    He said a lot o' things,

												    An' I fended him off at first,

												    But he got talkin' all around me,

												    Clost up to the things I'd be'n thinkin',

												    What's the use o' me goin' on, Jake,

												    You know.

												    He got all he wanted,

												    An' I give it to him,

												    An' what's more, I'm glad!

												    I ain't dead, anyway,

												    An' somebody thinks I'm somethin'.

												    Keep away, Jake,

												    You can kill me to-morrer if you want to,

												    But I'm goin' to have my say.

												    Funny thing!  Guess I ain't made to hold a man.

												    Elmer ain't be'n here for mor'n two months.

												    I don't want to pretend nothin',

												    Mebbe if he'd be'n lately

												    I shouldn't have told yer.

												    I'll go away in the mornin', o' course.

												    What you want the light fer?

												    I don't look no diff'rent.

												    Ain't the moon bright enough

												    To look at a woman that's deceived yer by?

												    Don't, Jake, don't, you can't love me now!

												    It ain't a question of forgiveness.

												    Why!  I'd be thinkin' o' Elmer ev'ry minute;

												    It ain't decent.

											    Oh, my God!  It ain't decent any more either way!

Nebbah min', you sassy rascal,
   He's gwine nab you atter while.

Choppin' suet in de kitchen,
   Stonin' raisins in de hall,
Beef a-cookin' fu' de mince meat,
   Spices groun'I smell 'em all.
Look hyeah, Tu'key, stop dat gobblin',
   You ain' luned de sense ob feah,
You ol' fool, yo' naik's in dangah,
   Do' you know Thanksgibbin's hyeah?

War Poems

Half a league, half a league,

												    Half a league onward,

												    All in the valley of Death

												    Rode the six hundred.

"Forward, the Light Brigade!

"Charge for the guns!" he said:

												    Into the valley of Death

											      Rode the six hundred.
												  æ
												  "Forward, the Light Brigade!"

												    Was there a man dismay'd?

												    Not tho' the soldier knew

												    Someone had blunder'd:

												    Theirs not to make reply,

												    Theirs not to reason why,

												    Theirs but to do and die:

												    Into the valley of Death

												    Rode the six hundred.
												  æ
												  Cannon to right of them,

												    Cannon to left of them,

												    Cannon in front of them

												    Volley'd and thunder'd;

												    Storm'd at with shot and shell,

												    Boldly they rode and well,

												    Into the jaws of Death,

												    Into the mouth of Hell

												    Rode the six hundred.
												  æ
												  Flash'd all their sabres bare,

												    Flash'd as they turn'd in air,

												    Sabring the gunners there,

												    Charging an army, while

												    All the world wonder'd:

												    Plunged in the battery-smoke

												    Right thro' the line they broke;

												    Cossack and Russian

												    Reel'd from the sabre stroke

												    Shatter'd and sunder'd.

												    Then they rode back, but not

												    Not the six hundred.
												  æ
												  Cannon to right of them,

												    Cannon to left of them,

												    Cannon behind them

												    Volley'd and thunder'd;

												    Storm'd at with shot and shell,

												    While horse and hero fell,

												    They that had fought so well

												    Came thro' the jaws of Death

												    Back from the mouth of Hell,

												    All that was left of them,

												    Left of six hundred.
												  æ
												  When can their glory fade?

												    O the wild charge they made!

												    All the world wondered.

												    Honor the charge they made,

												    Honor the Light Brigade,

											    Noble six hundred.

Death Poems

#######################################################

MARY sat musing on the lamp-flame at the table

												    Waiting for Warren. When she heard his step,

												    She ran on tip-toe down the darkened passage

												    To meet him in the doorway with the news

												    And put him on his guard. "Silas is back."

												    She pushed him outward with her through the door

												    And shut it after her. "Be kind," she said.

												    She took the market things from Warren's arms

												    And set them on the porch, then drew him down

												    To sit beside her on the wooden steps.

"When was I ever anything but kind to him?

But I'll not have the fellow back," he said.

"I told him so last haying, didn't I?

												    'If he left then,' I said, 'that ended it.'

												    What good is he? Who else will harbour him

												    At his age for the little he can do?

												    What help he is there's no depending on.

												    Off he goes always when I need him most.

												    'He thinks he ought to earn a little pay,

												    Enough at least to buy tobacco with,

												    So he won't have to beg and be beholden.'

												    'All right,' I say, 'I can't afford to pay

												    Any fixed wages, though I wish I could.'

												    'Someone else can.' 'Then someone else will have to.'

												    I shouldn't mind his bettering himself

												    If that was what it was. You can be certain,

												    When he begins like that, there's someone at him

												    Trying to coax him off with pocket-money,--

												    In haying time, when any help is scarce.

												    In winter he comes back to us. I'm done."

"Sh! not so loud: he'll hear you," Mary said.

"I want him to: he'll have to soon or late."

"He's worn out. He's asleep beside the stove.

												    When I came up from Rowe's I found him here,

												    Huddled against the barn-door fast asleep,

												    A miserable sight, and frightening, too--

												    You needn't smile--I didn't recognise him--

												    I wasn't looking for him--and he's changed.

												    Wait till you see."

"Where did you say he'd been?"

"He didn't say. I dragged him to the house,

												    And gave him tea and tried to make him smoke.

												    I tried to make him talk about his travels.

												    Nothing would do: he just kept nodding off."

"What did he say? Did he say anything?"

"But little."

"Anything? Mary, confess

He said he'd come to ditch the meadow for me."

"Warren!"

"But did he? I just want to know."

"Of course he did. What would you have him say?

												    Surely you wouldn't grudge the poor old man

												    Some humble way to save his self-respect.

												    He added, if you really care to know,

												    He meant to clear the upper pasture, too.

												    That sounds like something you have heard before?

												    Warren, I wish you could have heard the way

												    He jumbled everything. I stopped to look

												    Two or three times--he made me feel so queer--

												    To see if he was talking in his sleep.

												    He ran on Harold Wilson--you remember--

												    The boy you had in haying four years since.

												    He's finished school, and teaching in his college.

												    Silas declares you'll have to get him back.

												    He says they two will make a team for work:

												    Between them they will lay this farm as smooth!

												    The way he mixed that in with other things.

												    He thinks young Wilson a likely lad, though daft

												    On education--you know how they fought

												    All through July under the blazing sun,

												    Silas up on the cart to build the load,

												    Harold along beside to pitch it on."

"Yes, I took care to keep well out of earshot."

"Well, those days trouble Silas like a dream.

												    You wouldn't think they would. How some things linger!

												    Harold's young college boy's assurance piqued him.

												    After so many years he still keeps finding

												    Good arguments he sees he might have used.

												    I sympathise. I know just how it feels

												    To think of the right thing to say too late.

												    Harold's associated in his mind with Latin.

												    He asked me what I thought of Harold's saying

												    He studied Latin like the violin

												    Because he liked it--that an argument!

												    He said he couldn't make the boy believe

												    He could find water with a hazel prong--

												    Which showed how much good school had ever done him.

												    He wanted to go over that. But most of all

												    He thinks if he could have another chance

												    To teach him how to build a load of hay----"

"I know, that's Silas' one accomplishment.

												    He bundles every forkful in its place,

												    And tags and numbers it for future reference,

												    So he can find and easily dislodge it

												    In the unloading. Silas does that well.

												    He takes it out in bunches like big birds' nests.

												    You never see him standing on the hay

												    He's trying to lift, straining to lift himself."

"He thinks if he could teach him that, he'd be

												    Some good perhaps to someone in the world.

												    He hates to see a boy the fool of books.

												    Poor Silas, so concerned for other folk,

												    And nothing to look backward to with pride,

												    And nothing to look forward to with hope,

												    So now and never any different."

												    Part of a moon was falling down the west,

												    Dragging the whole sky with it to the hills.

												    Its light poured softly in her lap. She saw

												    And spread her apron to it. She put out her hand

												    Among the harp-like morning-glory strings,

												    Taut with the dew from garden bed to eaves,

												    As if she played unheard the tenderness

												    That wrought on him beside her in the night.

"Warren," she said, "he has come home to die:

You needn't be afraid he'll leave you this time."

"Home," he mocked gently.

"Yes, what else but home?

												    It all depends on what you mean by home.

												    Of course he's nothing to us, any more

												    Than was the hound that came a stranger to us

												    Out of the woods, worn out upon the trail."

"Home is the place where, when you have to go there,

They have to take you in."

"I should have called it

Something you somehow haven't to deserve."

												    Warren leaned out and took a step or two,

												    Picked up a little stick, and brought it back

												    And broke it in his hand and tossed it by.

"Silas has better claim on us you think

												    Than on his brother? Thirteen little miles

												    As the road winds would bring him to his door.

												    Silas has walked that far no doubt to-day.

												    Why didn't he go there? His brother's rich,

												    A somebody--director in the bank."

"He never told us that."

"We know it though."

"I think his brother ought to help, of course.

												    I'll see to that if there is need. He ought of right

												    To take him in, and might be willing to--

												    He may be better than appearances.

												    But have some pity on Silas. Do you think

												    If he'd had any pride in claiming kin

												    Or anything he looked for from his brother,

												    He'd keep so still about him all this time?"

"I wonder what's between them."

"I can tell you.

												    Silas is what he is--we wouldn't mind him--

												    But just the kind that kinsfolk can't abide.

												    He never did a thing so very bad.

												    He don't know why he isn't quite as good

												    As anyone. He won't be made ashamed

												    To please his brother, worthless though he is."

"I can't think Si ever hurt anyone."

"No, but he hurt my heart the way he lay

												    And rolled his old head on that sharp-edged chair-back.

												    He wouldn't let me put him on the lounge.

												    You must go in and see what you can do.

												    I made the bed up for him there to-night.

												    You'll be surprised at him--how much he's broken.

												    His working days are done; I'm sure of it."

"I'd not be in a hurry to say that."

"I haven't been. Go, look, see for yourself.

												    But, Warren, please remember how it is:

												    He's come to help you ditch the meadow.

												    He has a plan. You mustn't laugh at him.

												    He may not speak of it, and then he may.

												    I'll sit and see if that small sailing cloud

												    Will hit or miss the moon."

												    It hit the moon.

												    Then there were three there, making a dim row,

												    The moon, the little silver cloud, and she.

												    Warren returned--too soon, it seemed to her,

												    Slipped to her side, caught up her hand and waited.

"Warren," she questioned.

"Dead," was all he answered.

Showing how he went farther than he intended, and came safe home again.
											    
												  John Gilpin was a citizen
												  Of credit and renown,
												  A train-band captain eke was he,
												  Of famous London town.
												  æ
												  John Gilpin's spouse said to her dear,
												  "Though wedded we have been
												  These twice ten tedious years, yet we
												  No holiday have seen.
												  æ
												  "To-morrow is our wedding-day,
												  And we will then repair
												  Unto the 'Bell' at Edmonton,
												  All in a chaise and pair.
												  æ
												  "My sister, and my sister's child,
												  Myself, and children three,
												  Will fill the chaise; so you must ride
												  On horseback after we."
												  æ
												  He soon replied, "I do admire
												  Of womankind but one,
												  And you are she, my dearest dear,
												  Therefore it shall be done.
												  æ
												  "I am a linendraper bold,
												  As all the world doth know,
												  And my good friend the calender
												  Will lend his horse to go."
												  æ
												  Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, "That's well said;
												  And for that wine is dear,
												  We will be furnished with our own,
												  Which is both bright and clear."
												  æ
												  John Gilpin kissed his loving wife.
												  O'erjoyed was he to find.
												  That though on pleasure she was bent,
												  She had a frugal mind.
												  æ
												  The morning came, the chaise was brought,
												  But yet was not allowed
												  To drive up to the door, lest all
												  Should say that she was proud.
												  æ
												  So three doors off the chaise was stayed,
												  Where they did all get in;
												  Six precious souls, and all agog
												  To dash through thick and thin.
												  æ
												  Smack went the whip, round went the wheels,
												  Were never folks so glad!
												  The stones did rattle underneath,
												  As if Cheapside were mad.
												  æ
												  John Gilpin at his horse's side
												  Seized fast the flowing mane,
												  And up he got, in haste to ride,
												  But soon came down again;
												  æ
												  For saddletree scarce reached had he,
												  His journey to begin,
												  When, turning round his head, he saw
												  Three customers come in.
												  æ
												  So down he came; for loss of time,
												  Although it grieved him sore,
												  Yet loss of pence, full well he knew,
												  Would trouble him much more.
												  æ
												  'Twas long before the customers
												  Were suited to their mind,
												  When Betty screaming came downstairs,
												  "The wine is left behind!"
												  æ
												  "Good lack!" quoth he, "yet bring it me,
												  My leathern belt likewise,
												  In which I bear my trusty sword
												  When I do exercise."
												  æ
												  Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!)
												  Had two stone bottles found,
												  To hold the liquor that she loved,
												  And keep it safe and sound.
												  æ
												  Each bottle had a curling ear,
												  Through which the belt he drew,
												  And hung a bottle on each side,
												  To make his balance true.
												  æ
												  Then over all, that he might be
												  Equipped from top to toe,
												  His long red cloak, well brushed and neat,
												  He manfully did throw.
												  æ
												  Now see him mounted once again
												  Upon his nimble steed,
												  Full slowly pacing o'er the stones,
												  With caution and good heed.
												  æ
												  But finding soon a smoother road
												  Beneath his well-shod feet,
												  The snorting beast began to trot,
												  Which galled him in his seat.
												  æ
												  "So, fair and softly!" John he cried,
												  But John he cried in vain;
												  That trot became a gallop soon,
												  In spite of curb and rein.
												  æ
												  So stooping down, as needs he must
												  Who cannot sit upright,
												  He grasped the mane with both his hands,
												  And eke with all his might.
												  æ
												  His horse, who never in that sort
												  Had handled been before,
												  What thing upon his back had got,
												  Did wonder more and more.
												  æ
												  Away went Gilpin, neck or nought,
												  Away went hat and wig;
												  He little dreamt, when he set out,
												  Of running such a rig.
												  æ
												  The wind did blow, the cloak did fly
												  Like streamer long and gay,
												  Till, loop and button failing both.
												  At last it flew away.
												  æ
												  
												  Then might all people well discern
												  The bottles he had slung;
												  A bottle swinging at each side,
												  As hath been said or sung.
												  æ
												  The dogs did bark, the children screamed,
												  Up flew the windows all;
												  And every soul cried out, "Well done!"
												  As loud as he could bawl.
												  æ
												  Away went Gilpinäóîwho but he?
												  His fame soon spread around;
												  "He carries weight! he rides a race!
												  'Tis for a thousand pound!"
												  æ
												  And still as fast as he drew near,
												  'Twas wonderful to view
												  How in a trice the turnpike-men
												  Their gates wide open threw.
												  æ
												  And now, as he went bowing down
												  His reeking head full low,
												  The bottles twain behind his back
												  Were shattered at a blow.
												  æ
												  Down ran the wine into the road,
												  Most piteous to be seen,
												  Which made the horse's flanks to smoke,
												  As they had basted been.
												  æ
												  But still he seemed to carry weight.
												  With leathern girdle braced;
												  For all might see the bottle-necks
												  Still dangling at his waist.
												  æ
												  
												  Thus all through merry Islington
												  These gambols he did play,
												  Until he came unto the Wash
												  Of Edmonton so gay;
												  æ
												  And there he threw the wash about
												  On both sides of the way,
												  Just like unto a trundling mop,
												  Or a wild goose at play.
												  æ
												  At Edmonton his loving wife
												  From the balcony spied
												  Her tender husband, wondering much
												  To see how he did ride.
												  æ
												  "Stop, stop, John Gilpin!äóîHere's the house!"
												  They all at once did cry;
												  "The dinner waits, and we are tired;"
												  Said Gilpinäóî"So am I!"
												  æ
												  But yet his horse was not a whit
												  Inclined to tarry there;
												  For why?äóîhis owner had a house
												  Full ten miles off, at Ware.
												  æ
												  So like an arrow swift he flew,
												  Shot by an archer strong;
												  So did he flyäóîwhich brings me to
												  The middle of my song.
												  æ
												  Away went Gilpin, out of breath,
												  And sore against his will,
												  Till at his friend the calender's
												  His horse at last stood still.
												  æ
												  The calender, amazed to see
												  His neighbour in such trim,
												  Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate.
												  And thus accosted him:
												  æ
												  "What news? what news? your tidings tell;
												  Tell me you must and shalläóî
												  Say why bareheaded you are come,
												  Or why you come at all?"
												  æ
												  Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit,
												  And loved a timely joke;
												  And thus unto the calender
												  In merry guise he spoke:
												  æ
												  "I came because your horse would come;
												  And, if I well forebode,
												  My hat and wig will soon be here,
												  They are upon the road."
												  æ
												  The calender, right glad to find
												  His friend in merry pin,
												  Returned him not a single word,
												  But to the house went in;
												  æ
												  Whence straight he came with hat and wig,
												  A wig that flowed behind,
												  A hat not much the worse for wear,
												  Each comely in its kind.
												  æ
												  He held them up, and in his turn
												  Thus showed his ready wit:
												  "My head is twice as big as yours,
												  They therefore needs must fit."
												  æ
												  "But let me scrape the dirt away,
												  That hangs upon your face;
												  And stop and eat, for well you may
												  Be in a hungry case."
												  æ
												  Said John, "It is my wedding-day,
												  And all the world would stare
												  If wife should dine at Edmonton,
												  And I should dine at Ware."
												  æ
												  So turning to his horse, he said
												  "I am in haste to dine;
												  'Twas for your pleasure you came here,
												  You shall go back for mine."
												  æ
												  Ah! luckless speech, and bootless boast!
												  For which he paid full dear;
												  For while he spake, a braying ass
												  Did sing most loud and clear;
												  æ
												  Whereat his horse did snort, as he
												  Had heard a lion roar,
												  And galloped off with all his might,
												  As he had done before.
												  æ
												  Away went Gilpin, and away
												  Went Gilpin's hat and wig;
												  He lost them sooner than at first,
												  For why?äóîthey were too big.
												  æ
												  Now Mistress Gilpin, when she saw
												  Her husband posting down
												  Into the country far away,
												  She pulled out half-a-crown;
												  æ
												  And thus unto the youth she said
												  That drove them to the "Bell,"
												  "This shall be yours when you bring back
												  My husband safe and well."
												  æ
												  The youth did ride, and soon did meet
												  John coming back amain;
												  Whom in a trice he tried to stop,
												  By catching at his rein.
												  æ
												  But not performing what he meant,
												  And gladly would have done,
												  The frighted steed he frighted more,
												  And made him faster run.
												  æ
												  Away went Gilpin, and away
												  Went postboy at his heels,
												  The postboy's horse right glad to miss
												  The lumbering of the wheels.
												  æ
												  Six gentlemen upon the road,
												  Thus seeing Gilpin fly,
												  With postboy scampering in the rear.
												  They raised the hue and cry.
												  æ
												  "Stop thief! stop thief! a highwayman!'"
												  Not one of them was mute;
												  And all and each that passed that way
												  Did join in the pursuit.
												  æ
												  And now the turnpike-gates again
												  Flew open in short space;
												  The toll-man thinking, as before,
												  That Gilpin rode a race.
												  æ
												  And so he did, and won it too,
												  For he got first to town;
												  Nor stopped till where he had got up,
												  He did again get down.
												  æ
												  Now let us sing, Long live the King,
												  And Gilpin, long live he;
												  And when he next doth ride abroad.
												  May I be there to see.

A GERMAN FAIRY TALE
											    
										        A fisherman, poor as poor can be,

												    Who lived in a hovel beside the sea,

												    Was fishing one day, when "Lo!" he cries,

												    "I've caught a flounder of wondrous size!

												    As fine a flounder as one could wish!"

												    "O no! you haven't!" exclaimed the fish;

												    "In spite of my scaly skin," he said,

												    "I am not a fish, but a Prince instead;

												    Condemned to suffer this watery woe;

												    So I beg, good man, you will let me go!"

												    The fisherman, frightened at what he heard,

												    Let the flounder go with never a word

												    Except "Goodbye! I'd rather eschew

												    Than cook a flounder who talks like you!"

												    His hovel now the fisherman sought,

												    And told his wife of the fish he caught,

												    And how his luck was all in vain,

												    For he let the flounder off again!

												    "And did you ask for nothing?--alack!"

												    The woman cried: "Go presently back,

												    And tell the Prince our wretched lot,

												    And ask him to give us a finer cot!"

												    To mind his wife he was something loth,

												    But he feared the woman when she was wroth

												    And so he went to the ocean-side,

												    And thus the fisherman loudly cried:

												    "O good flounder in the sea,

												    Hither quickly come to me;

												    For Pauline, my loving dame,

												    Wants queer things I fear to name."

												    Whereat the flounder, swimming near,

												    Said, "Why, O why, am I summoned here?"

												    And the trembling fisherman answered thus:

												    "My dame is always making a fuss;

												    A cosey hovel is hers and mine,

												    But she fain would have a cottage fine!"

												    "Go home," said the fish, "this very minute;

												    The cottage is hers; you'll find her in it!"

												    He hied him home in haste, and lo!

												    The fisherman found it even so.

												    "How happy," he cried, "we now shall be!"

												    But the woman answered, "We shall see!"

												    When a month was past, the woman sighed

												    For a larger house. "Now go," she cried,

												    "And tell the flounder ('t is my command)

												    I want a mansion large and grand!"

												    To mind the dame he was truly loth,

												    But he feared the woman when she was wroth;

												    So he went again to the ocean-side,

												    And loudly thus the fisherman cried:

												    "O good flounder in the sea,

												    Hither quickly come to me;

												    For Pauline, my loving dame,

												    Wants queer things I fear to name."

												    Whereat the flounder, swimming near,

												    Said, "Why again am I summoned here?"

												    And the trembling fisherman answered thus:

												    "My wife is always making a fuss;

												    She deems our cottage much too small;

												    She wants a mansion large and tall."

												    "Go home," said the fish, "this very minute;

												    The mansion is there--you'll find her in it!"

												    He hied him home in haste, and lo!

												    The fisherman found it even so!

												    And he cried, "How happy we shall be!"

												    But the woman answered, "We shall see!"

												    When a week was past, the woman sighed

												    For a castle grand. "Now go," she cried,

												    "And tell the flounder that he must give

												    Your wife a palace wherein to live."

												    To mind the dame he was greatly loth,

												    But he feared the woman when she was wroth;

												    So he went again to the ocean-side,

												    And softly thus the fisherman cried:

												    "O good flounder in the sea,

												    Hither quickly come to me;

												    For Pauline, my loving dame,

												    Wants queer things I fear to name!"

												    Whereat the flounder, swimming near,

												    Said, "Why again am I summoned here?"

												    And the trembling fisherman answered thus:

												    "My dame is always making a fuss;

												    She deems our mansion poorly planned;

												    She wants a palace great and grand!"

												    "Go home," said the fish, "this very minute;

												    The palace is there--you'll find her in it!"

												    He hied him home in haste, and, lo!

												    The fisherman found it even so,

												    And he cried, "How happy we shall be!"

												    But the woman answered, "We shall see!"

												    When a day was past, with growing pride,

												    For regal power the woman sighed;

												    And she bade the fisherman tell the fish

												    To reign as a king was now her wish.

												    To mind the dame he was sadly loth,

												    But he feared the woman when she was wroth,

												    So he went again to the ocean-side,

												    And softly thus the fisherman cried:

												    "O good flounder in the sea,

												    Hither quickly come to me;

												    For Pauline, my loving dame,

												    Wants queer things I fear to name."

												    Whereat the flounder, swimming near,

												    Said, "Why again am I summoned here?"

												    And the trembling fisherman answered thus:

												    "My dame is always making a fuss;

												    She has got a palace great and grand,

												    And now she asks for royal command!"

												    "Go home!" said the fish, "at the palace gate

												    You'll find her a kind in royal state!"

												    He hied him home in haste, and, lo!

												    The fisherman found it even so.

												    "Good faith," said he, "'tis a charming thing

												    To be, like you, a sovereign king!

												    With a golden crown upon your brow,

												    I'm sure you'll be contented now!"

												    "Not I, indeed," the woman said,

												    "A triple crown would grace my head;

												    And I am worthy, I humbly hope--

												    Go tell the flounder to make me Pope!"

												    "A Pope? my dear--it cannot be done!

												    The Church, you know, allows but one!"

												    "Nay, none of your nonsense, man," said she,

												    "A Pope--a Pope I am bound to be!

												    The Prince will find it an easy thing

												    To make a pope as to make a king!"

												    To mind the dame he was sorely loth,

												    But he feared the woman when she was wroth,

												    So he went again to the ocean-side,

												    And thus the fisherman faintly cried:

												    "O good flounder in the sea,

												    Hither quickly come to me,

												    For Pauline, my loving dame,

												    Wants queer things I fear to name!"

												    Whereat the flounder, swimming near,

												    Said, "Why again am I summoned here?"

												    "Alack, alack!" the fisherman said,

												    "Whatever has turned the woman's head,

												    She is ill-content with royal scope,

												    And now, good luck! she would fain be Pope!"

												    "Go home!" the flounder gruffly cried,

												    "And see the end of foolish pride;

												    You'll find her in her hovel again,

												    And there, till death, shall she remain!"



Narrative Poems

#######################################################

'Tis eight o'clock,äóîa clear March night,

												    The moon is up,äóîthe sky is blue,

												    The owlet, in the moonlight air,

												    Shouts from nobody knows where;

												    He lengthens out his lonely shout,

											      Halloo! halloo! a long halloo!
												  æ
												  äóîWhy bustle thus about your door,

												    What means this bustle, Betty Foy?

												    Why are you in this mighty fret?

												    And why on horseback have you set

												    Him whom you love, your Idiot Boy?
												  æ
												  Scarcely a soul is out of bed:

												    Good Betty, put him down again;

												    His lips with joy they burr at you;

												    But, Betty! what has he to do

												    With stirrup, saddle, or with rein?
												  æ
												  But Betty's bent on her intent;

												    For her good neighbour, Susan Gale,

												    Old Susan, she who dwells alone,

												    Is sick, and makes a piteous moan,

												    As if her very life would fail.
												  æ
												  There's not a house within a mile,

												    No hand to help them in distress;

												    Old Susan lies a-bed in pain,

												    And sorely puzzled are the twain,

												    For what she ails they cannot guess.
												  æ
												  And Betty's husband's at the wood,

												    Where by the week he doth abide,

												    A woodman in the distant vale;

												    There's none to help poor Susan Gale;

												    What must be done? what will betide?
												  æ
												  And Betty from the lane has fetched

												    Her Pony, that is mild and good;

												    Whether he be in joy or pain,

												    Feeding at will along the lane,

												    Or bringing faggots from the wood.
												  æ
												  And he is all in travelling trim,äóî

												    And, by the moonlight, Betty Foy

												    Has on the well-girt saddle set

												    (The like was never heard of yet)

												    Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy.
												  æ
												  And he must post without delay

												    Across the bridge and through the dale,

												    And by the church, and o'er the down,

												    To bring a Doctor from the town,

												    Or she will die, old Susan Gale.
												  æ
												  There is no need of boot or spur,

												    There is no need of whip or wand;

												    For Johnny has his holly-bough,

												    And with a hurly-burly now

												    He shakes the green bough in his hand.
												  æ
												  And Betty o'er and o'er has told

												    The Boy, who is her best delight,

												    Both what to follow, what to shun,

												    What do, and what to leave undone,

												    How turn to left, and how to right.
												  æ
												  And Betty's most especial charge,

												    Was, "Johnny! Johnny! mind that you

												    Come home again, nor stop at all,äóî

												    Come home again, whate'er befal,

												    My Johnny, do, I pray you do."
												  æ
												  To this did Johnny answer make,

												    Both with his head and with his hand,

												    And proudly shook the bridle too;

												    And then! his words were not a few,

												    Which Betty well could understand.
												  æ
												  And now that Johnny is just going,

												    Though Betty's in a mighty flurry,

												    She gently pats the Pony's side,

												    On which her Idiot Boy must ride,

												    And seems no longer in a hurry.
												  æ
												  But when the Pony moved his legs,

												    Oh! then for the poor Idiot Boy!

												    For joy he cannot hold the bridle,

												    For joy his head and heels are idle,

												    He's idle all for very joy.
												  æ
												  And while the Pony moves his legs,

												    In Johnny's left hand you may see

												    The green bough motionless and dead:

												    The Moon that shines above his head

												    Is not more still and mute than he.
												  æ
												  His heart it was so full of glee,

												    That till full fifty yards were gone,

												    He quite forgot his holly whip,

												    And all his skill in horsemanship:

												    Oh! happy, happy, happy John.
												  æ
												  And while the Mother, at the door,

												    Stands fixed, her face with joy o'erflows

												    Proud of herself, and proud of him,

												    She sees him in his travelling trim,

												    How quietly her Johnny goes.
												  æ
												  The silence of her Idiot Boy,

												    What hopes it sends to Betty's heart!

												    He's at the guide-postäóîhe turns right;

												    She watches till he's out of sight,

												    And Betty will not then depart.
												  æ
												  Burr, burräóînow Johnny's lips they burr.

												    As loud as any mill, or near it;

												    Meek as a lamb the Pony moves,

												    And Johnny makes the noise he loves,

												    And Betty listens, glad to hear it.
												  æ
												  Away she hies to Susan Gale:

												    Her Messenger's in merry tune;

												    The owlets hoot, the owlets curr,

												    And Johnny's lips they burr, burr, burr,

												    As on he goes beneath the moon.
												  æ
												  His steed and he right well agree;

												    For of this Pony there's a rumour,

												    That, should he lose his eyes and ears,

												    And should he live a thousand years,

												    He never will be out of humour.
												  æ
												  But then he is a horse that thinks!

												    And when he thinks, his pace is slack;

												    Now, though he knows poor Johnny well,

												    Yet, for his life, he cannot tell

												    What he has got upon his back.
												  æ
												  So through the moonlight lanes they go,

												    And far into the moonlight dale,

												    And by the church, and o'er the down,

												    To bring a Doctor from the town,

												    To comfort poor old Susan Gale.
												  æ
												  And Betty, now at Susan's side,

												    Is in the middle of her story,

												    What speedy help her Boy will bring,

												    With many a most diverting thing,

												    Of Johnny's wit, and Johnny's glory.
												  æ
												  And Betty, still at Susan's side,

												    By this time is not quite so flurried:

												    Demure with porringer and plate

												    She sits, as if in Susan's fate

												    Her life and soul were buried.
												  æ
												  But Betty, poor good woman! she,

												    You plainly in her face may read it,

												    Could lend out of that moment's store

												    Five years of happiness or more

												    To any that might need it.
												  æ
												  But yet I guess that now and then

												    With Betty all was not so well;

												    And to the road she turns her ears,

												    And thence full many a sound she hears,

												    Which she to Susan will not tell.
												  æ
												  Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans;

												    "As sure as there's a moon in heaven,"

												    Cries Betty, "he'll be back again;

												    They'll both be hereäóî'tis almost tenäóî

												    Both will be here before eleven."
												  æ
												  Poor Susan moans, poor Susan groans;

												    The clock gives warning for eleven;

												    'Tis on the strokeäóî"He must be near,"

												    Quoth Betty, "and will soon be here,

												    As sure as there's a moon in heaven."
												  æ
												  The clock is on the stroke of twelve,

												    And Johnny is not yet in sight:

												    äóîThe Moon's in heaven, as Betty sees,

												    But Betty is not quite at ease;

												    And Susan has a dreadful night.
												  æ
												  And Betty, half an hour ago,

												    On Johnny vile reflections cast:

												    "A little idle sauntering Thing!"

												    With other names, an endless string;

												    But now that time is gone and past.
												  æ
												  And Betty's drooping at the heart,

												    That happy time all past and gone,

												    "How can it be he is so late?

												    The Doctor, he has made him wait;

												    Susan! they'll both be here anon."
												  æ
												  And Susan's growing worse and worse,

												    And Betty's in a sad quandary;

												    And then there's nobody to say

												    If she must go, or she must stay!

												    äóîShe's in a sad quandary.
												  æ
												  The clock is on the stroke of one;

												    But neither Doctor nor his Guide

												    Appears along the moonlight road;

												    There's neither horse nor man abroad,

												    And Betty's still at Susan's side.
												  æ
												  And Susan now begins to fear

												    Of sad mischances not a few,

												    That Johnny may perhaps be drowned;

												    Or lost, perhaps, and never found;

												    Which they must both for ever rue.
												  æ
												  She prefaced half a hint of this

												    With, "God forbid it should be true!"

												    At the first word that Susan said

												    Cried Betty, rising from the bed,

												    "Susan, I'd gladly stay with you.
												  æ
												  "I must be gone, I must away:

												    Consider, Johnny's but half-wise;

												    Susan, we must take care of him,

												    If he is hurt in life or limb"äóî

												    "Oh God forbid!" poor Susan cries.
												  æ
												  "What can I do?" says Betty, going,

												    "What can I do to ease your pain?

												    Good Susan tell me, and I'll stay;

												    I fear you're in a dreadful way,

												    But I shall soon be back again."
												  æ
												  "Nay, Betty, go! good Betty, go!

												    There's nothing that can ease my pain."

												    Then off she hies; but with a prayer

												    That God poor Susan's life would spare,

												    Till she comes back again.
												  æ
												  So, through the moonlight lane she goes,

												    And far into the moonlight dale;

												    And how she ran, and how she walked,

												    And all that to herself she talked,

												    Would surely be a tedious tale.
												  æ
												  In high and low, above, below,

												    In great and small, in round and square,

												    In tree and tower was Johnny seen,

												    In bush and brake, in black and green;

												    'Twas Johnny, Johnny, every where.
												  æ
												  And while she crossed the bridge, there came

												    A thought with which her heart is soreäóî

												    Johnny perhaps his horse forsook,

												    To hunt the moon within the brook,

												    And never will be heard of more.
												  æ
												  Now is she high upon the down,

												    Alone amid a prospect wide;

												    There's neither Johnny nor his Horse

												    Among the fern or in the gorse;

												    There's neither Doctor nor his Guide.
												  æ
												  "Oh saints! what is become of him?

												    Perhaps he's climbed into an oak,

												    Where he will stay till he is dead;

												    Or, sadly he has been misled,

												    And joined the wandering gipsy-folk.
												  æ
												  "Or him that wicked Pony's carried

												    To the dark cave, the goblin's hall;

												    Or in the castle he's pursuing

												    Among the ghosts his own undoing;

												    Or playing with the waterfall."
												  æ
												  At poor old Susan then she railed,

												    While to the town she posts away;

												    "If Susan had not been so ill,

												    Alas! I should have had him still,

												    My Johnny, till my dying day."
												  æ
												  Poor Betty, in this sad distemper,

												    The Doctor's self could hardly spare:

												    Unworthy things she talked, and wild;

												    Even he, of cattle the most mild,

												    The Pony had his share.
												  æ
												  But now she's fairly in the town,

												    And to the Doctor's door she hies;

												    'Tis silence all on every side;

												    The town so long, the town so wide,

												    Is silent as the skies.
												  æ
												  And now she's at the Doctor's door,

												    She lifts the knocker, rap, rap, rap;

												    The Doctor at the casement shows

												    His glimmering eyes that peep and doze!

												    And one hand rubs his old night-cap.
												  æ
												  "Oh Doctor! Doctor! where's my Johnny?"

												    "I'm here, what is't you want with me?"

												    "Oh Sir! you know I'm Betty Foy,

												    And I have lost my poor dear Boy,

												    You know himäóîhim you often see;
												  æ
												  "He's not so wise as some folks be":

												    "The devil take his wisdom!" said

												    The Doctor, looking somewhat grim,

												    "What, Woman! should I know of him?"

												    And, grumbling, he went back to bed!
												  æ
												  "O woe is me! O woe is me!

												    Here will I die; here will I die;

												    I thought to find my lost one here,

												    But he is neither far nor near,

												    Oh! what a wretched Mother I!"
												  æ
												  She stops, she stands, she looks about;

												    Which way to turn she cannot tell.

												    Poor Betty! it would ease her pain

												    If she had heart to knock again;

												    äóîThe clock strikes threeäóîa dismal knell!
												  æ
												  Then up along the town she hies,

												    No wonder if her senses fail;

												    This piteous news so much it shocked her,

												    She quite forgot to send the Doctor,

												    To comfort poor old Susan Gale.
												  æ
												  And now she's high upon the down,

												    And she can see a mile of road:

												    "O cruel! I'm almost threescore;

												    Such night as this was ne'er before,

												    There's not a single soul abroad."
												  æ
												  She listens, but she cannot hear

												    The foot of horse, the voice of man;

												    The streams with softest sound are flowing,

												    The grass you almost hear it growing,

												    You hear it now, if e'er you can.
												  æ
												  The owlets through the long blue night

												    Are shouting to each other still:

												    Fond lovers! yet not quite hob nob,

												    They lengthen out the tremulous sob,

												    That echoes far from hill to hill.
												  æ
												  Poor Betty now has lost all hope,

												    Her thoughts are bent on deadly sin,

												    A green-grown pond she just has past,

												    And from the brink she hurries fast,

												    Lest she should drown herself therein.
												  æ
												  And now she sits her down and weeps;

												    Such tears she never shed before;

												    "Oh dear, dear Pony! my sweet joy!

												    Oh carry back my Idiot Boy!

												    And we will ne'er o'erload thee more."
												  æ
												  A thought is come into her head:

												    The Pony he is mild and good,

												    And we have always used him well;

												    Perhaps he's gone along the dell,

												    And carried Johnny to the wood.
												  æ
												  Then up she springs as if on wings;

												    She thinks no more of deadly sin;

												    If Betty fifty ponds should see,

												    The last of all her thoughts would be

												    To drown herself therein.
												  æ
												  O Reader! now that I might tell

												    What Johnny and his Horse are doing!

												    What they've been doing all this time,

												    Oh could I put it into rhyme,

												    A most delightful tale pursuing!
												  æ
												  Perhaps, and no unlikely thought!

												    He with his Pony now doth roam

												    The cliffs and peaks so high that are,

												    To lay his hands upon a star,

												    And in his pocket bring it home.
												  æ
												  Perhaps he's turned himself about,

												    His face unto his horse's tail,

												    And, still and mute, in wonder lost,

												    All silent as a horseman-ghost,

												    He travels slowly down the vale.
												  æ
												  And now, perhaps, is hunting sheep,

												    A fierce and dreadful hunter he;

												    Yon valley, now so trim and green,

												    In five months' time, should he be seen,

												    A desert wilderness will be!
												  æ
												  Perhaps, with head and heels on fire,

												    And like the very soul of evil,

												    He's galloping away, away,

												    And so will gallop on for aye,

												    The bane of all that dread the devil!
												  æ
												  I to the Muses have been bound

												    These fourteen years, by strong indentures:

												    O gentle Muses! let me tell

												    But half of what to him befel;

												    He surely met with strange adventures.
												  æ
												  O gentle Muses! is this kind?

												    Why will ye thus my suit repel?

												    Why of your further aid bereave me?

												    And can ye thus unfriended leave me;

												    Ye Muses! whom I love so well?
												  æ
												  Who's yon, that, near the waterfall,

												    Which thunders down with headlong force

												    Beneath the moon, yet shining fair,

												    As careless as if nothing were,

												    Sits upright on a feeding horse?
												  æ
												  Unto his horseäóîthere feeding free,

												    He seems, I think, the rein to give;

												    Of moon or stars he takes no heed;

												    Of such we in romances read:

												    äóî'Tis Johnny! Johnny! as I live.
												  æ
												  And that's the very Pony, too!

												    Where is she, where is Betty Foy?

												    She hardly can sustain her fears;

												    The roaring waterfall she hears,

												    And cannot find her Idiot Boy.
												  æ
												  Your Pony's worth his weight in gold:

												    Then calm your terrors, Betty Foy!

												    She's coming from among the trees,

												    And now all full in view she sees

												    Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy.
												  æ
												  And Betty sees the Pony too:

												    Why stand you thus, good Betty Foy?

												    It is no goblin, 'tis no ghost,

												    'Tis he whom you so long have lost,

												    He whom you love, your Idiot Boy.
												  æ
												  She looks againäóîher arms are upäóî

												    She screamsäóîshe cannot move for joy;

												    She darts, as with a torrent's force,

												    She almost has o'erturned the Horse,

												    And fast she holds her Idiot Boy.
												  æ
												  And Johnny burrs, and laughs aloud;

												    Whether in cunning or in joy

												    I cannot tell; but while he laughs,

												    Betty a drunken pleasure quaffs

												    To hear again her Idiot Boy.
												  æ
												  And now she's at the Pony's tail,

												    And now is at the Pony's head,äóî

												    On that side now, and now on this;

												    And, almost stifled with her bliss,

												    A few sad tears does Betty shed.
												  æ
												  She kisses o'er and o'er again

												    Him whom she loves, her Idiot Boy;

												    She's happy here, is happy there,

												    She is uneasy every where;

												    Her limbs are all alive with joy.
												  æ
												  She pats the Pony, where or when

												    She knows not, happy Betty Foy!

												    The little Pony glad may be,

												    But he is milder far than she,

												    You hardly can perceive his joy.
												  æ
												  "Oh! Johnny, never mind the Doctor;

												    You've done your best, and that is all:"

												    She took the reins, when this was said,

												    And gently turned the Pony's head

												    From the loud waterfall.
												  æ
												  By this the stars were almost gone,

												    The moon was setting on the hill,

												    So pale you scarcely looked at her:

												    The little birds began to stir,

												    Though yet their tongues were still.
												  æ
												  The Pony, Betty, and her Boy,

												    Wind slowly through the woody dale;

												    And who is she, betimes abroad,

												    That hobbles up the steep rough road?

												    Who is it, but old Susan Gale?
												  æ
												  Long time lay Susan lost in thought;

												    And many dreadful fears beset her,

												    Both for her Messenger and Nurse;

												    And, as her mind grew worse and worse,

												    Her bodyäóîit grew better.
												  æ
												  She turned, she tossed herself in bed,

												    On all sides doubts and terrors met her;

												    Point after point did she discuss;

												    And, while her mind was fighting thus,

												    Her body still grew better.
												  æ
												  "Alas! what is become of them?

												    These fears can never be endured;

												    I'll to the wood."äóîThe word scarce said,

												    Did Susan rise up from her bed,

												    As if by magic cured.
												  æ
												  Away she goes up hill and down,

												    And to the wood at length is come;

												    She spies her Friends, she shouts a greeting;

												    Oh me! it is a merry meeting

												    As ever was in Christendom.
												  æ
												  The owls have hardly sung their last,

												    While our four travellers homeward wend;

												    The owls have hooted all night long,

												    And with the owls began my song,

												    And with the owls must end.
												  æ
												  For while they all were travelling home,

												    Cried Betty, "Tell us, Johnny, do,

												    Where all this long night you have been,

												    What you have heard, what you have seen:

												    And, Johnny, mind you tell us true."
												  æ
												  Now Johnny all night long had heard

												    The owls in tuneful concert strive;

												    No doubt too he the moon had seen;

												    For in the moonlight he had been 

												    From eight o'clock till five.
												  æ
												  And thus, to Betty's question, he

												    Made answer, like a traveller bold,

												    (His very words I give to you,)

												    "The cocks did crow to-whoo, to-whoo,

												    And the sun did shine so cold!"

												    äóîThus answered Johnny in his glory,

											    And that was all his travel's story.

Dramatic Poems

#######################################################

NOW that they've got it settled whose I be,

												    I'm going to tell them something they won't like:

												    They've got it settled wrong, and I can prove it.

												    Flattered I must be to have two towns fighting

												    To make a present of me to each other.

												    They don't dispose me, either one of them,

												    To spare them any trouble. Double trouble's

												    Always the witch's motto anyway.

												    I'll double theirs for both of them--you watch me.

												    They'll find they've got the whole thing to do over,

												    That is, if facts is what they want to go by.

												    They set a lot (now don't they?) by a record

												    Of Arthur Amy's having once been up

												    For Hog Reeve in March Meeting here in Warren.

												    I could have told them any time this twelvemonth

												    The Arthur Amy I was married to

												    Couldn't have been the one they say was up

												    In Warren at March Meeting for the reason

												    He wa'n't but fifteen at the time they say.

												    The Arthur Amy I was married to

												    voted the only times he ever voted,

												    Which wasn't many, in the town of Wentworth.

												    One of the times was when 'twas in the warrant

												    To see if the town wanted to take over

												    The tote road to our clearing where we lived.

												    I'll tell you who'd remember--Heman Lapish.

												    Their Arthur Amy was the father of mine.

												    So now they've dragged it through the law courts once

												    I guess they'd better drag it through again.

												    Wentworth and Warren's both good towns to live in,

												    Only I happen to prefer to live

												    In Wentworth from now on; and when all's said,

												    Right's right, and the temptation to do right

												    When I can hurt someone by doing it

												    Has always been too much for me, it has.

												    I know of some folks that'd be set up

												    At having in their town a noted witch:

												    But most would have to think of the expense

												    That even I would be. They ought to know

												    That as a witch I'd often milk a bat

												    And that'd be enough to last for days.

												    It'd make my position stronger, I think,

												    If I was to consent to give some sign

												    To make it surer that I was a witch?

												    It wa'n't no sign, I s'pose, when Mallice Huse

												    Said that I took him out in his old age

												    And rode all over everything on him

												    Until I'd had him worn to skin and bones,

												    And if I'd left him hitched unblanketed

												    In front of one Town Hall, I'd left him hitched

												    In front of every one in Grafton County.

												    Some cried shame on me not to blanket him,

												    The poor old man. It would have been all right

												    If some one hadn't said to gnaw the posts

												    He stood beside and leave his trade mark on them,

												    So they could recognize them. Not a post

												    That they could hear tell of was scarified.

												    They made him keep on gnawing till he whined.

												    Then that same smarty someone said to look--

												    He'd bet Huse was a cribber and had gnawed

												    The crib he slept in--and as sure's you're born

												    They found he'd gnawed the four posts of his bed,

												    All four of them to splinters. What did that prove?

												    Not that he hadn't gnawed the hitching posts

												    He said he had besides. Because a horse

												    Gnaws in the stable ain't no proof to me

												    He don't gnaw trees and posts and fences too.

												    But everybody took it for proof.

												    I was a strapping girl of twenty then.

												    The smarty someone who spoiled everything

												    Was Arthur Amy. You know who he was.

												    That was the way he started courting me.

												    He never said much after we were married,

												    But I mistrusted he was none too proud

												    Of having interfered in the Huse business.

												    I guess he found he got more out of me

												    By having me a witch. Or something happened

												    To turn him round. He got to saying things

												    To undo what he'd done and make it right,

												    Like, "No, she ain't come back from kiting yet.

												    Last night was one of her nights out. She's kiting.

												    She thinks when the wind makes a night of it

												    She might as well herself." But he liked best

												    To let on he was plagued to death with me:

												    If anyone had seen me coming home

												    Over the ridgepole, 'stride of a broomstick,

												    As often as he had in the tail of the night,

												    He guessed they'd know what he had to put up with.

												    Well, I showed Arthur Amy signs enough

												    Off from the house as far as we could keep

												    And from barn smells you can't wash out of ploughed ground

												    With all the rain and snow of seven years;

												    And I don't mean just skulls of Roger's Rangers

												    On Moosilauke, but woman signs to man,

												    Only bewitched so I would last him longer.

												    Up where the trees grow short, the mosses tall,

												    I made him gather me wet snow berries

												    On slippery rocks beside a waterfall.

												    I made him do it for me in the dark.

												    And he liked everything I made him do.

												    I hope if he is where he sees me now

												    He's so far off he can't see what I've come to.

												    You _can_ come down from everything to nothing.

												    All is, if I'd a-known when I was young

												    And full of it, that this would be the end,

												    It doesn't seem as if I'd had the courage

												    To make so free and kick up in folks' faces.

											      I might have, but it doesn't seem as if.



Narrative Poems

'Twas on the shores that round our coast

												    From Deal to Ramsgate span,

												    That I found alone on a piece of stone

											      An elderly naval man.
												  æ
												  His hair was weedy, his beard was long, 

												    And weedy and long was he, 

												    And I heard this wight on the shore recite, 

												    In a singular minor key:
												  æ
												  "Oh, I am a cook and a captain bold, 

												    And the mate of the Nancy brig, 

												    And a bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite, 

												    And the crew of the captain's gig."
												  æ
												  And he shook his fists and he tore his hair,

												    Till I really felt afraid,

												    For I couldn't help thinking the man had been drinking,

												    And so I simply said:
												  æ
												  "Oh, elderly man, it's little I know

												    Of the duties of men of the sea,

												    And I'll eat my hand if I understand

												    However you can be
												  æ
												  'At once a cook, and a captain bold,

												    And the mate of the Nancy brig,

												    And a bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,

												    And the crew of the captain's gig.'"
												  æ
												  Then he gave a hitch to his trousers, which

												    Is a trick all seamen larn,

												    And having got rid of a thumping quid,

												    He spun this painful yarn:
												  æ
												  "'Twas in the good ship Nancy Bell

												    That we sailed to the Indian Sea,

												    And there on a reef we come to grief,

												    Which has often occurred to me.
												  æ
												  'And pretty nigh all the crew was drowned

												    (There was seventy-seven o' soul),

												    And only ten of the Nancy's men

												    Said 'Here!' to the muster-roll.
												  æ
												  'There was me and the cook and the captain bold,

												    And the mate of the Nancy brig,

												    And the bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,

												    And the crew of the captain's gig.
												  æ
												  'For a month we'd neither wittles nor drink,

												    Till a-hungry we did feel,

												    So we drawed a lot, and, accordin' shot

												    The captain for our meal.
												  æ
												  'The next lot fell to the Nancy's mate,

												    And a delicate dish he made;

												    Then our appetite with the midshipmite

												    We seven survivors stayed.
												  æ
												  'And then we murdered the bo'sun tight,

												    And he much resembled pig;

												    Then we wittled free, did the cook and me,

												    On the crew of the captain's gig.
												  æ
												  'Then only the cook and me was left,

												    And the delicate question,"Which

												    Of us two goes to the kettle" arose,

												    And we argued it out as sich. 
												  æ
												  'For I loved that cook as a brother, I did,

												    And the cook he worshipped me;

												    But we'd both be blowed if we'd either be stowed

												    In the other chap's hold, you see.
												  æ
												  "I'll be eat if you dines off me,"says TOM;

												    'Yes, that,' says I, 'you'll be, '

												    'I'm boiled if I die, my friend, ' quoth I;

												    And "Exactly so," quoth he.
												  æ
												  'Says he,"Dear JAMES, to murder me

												    Were a foolish thing to do,

												    For don't you see that you can't cook me,

												    While I can and will cook you!"
												  æ
												  'So he boils the water, and takes the salt

												    And the pepper in portions true

												    (Which he never forgot), and some chopped shalot.

												    And some sage and parsley too.
												  æ
												  "Come here,"says he, with a proper pride,

												    Which his smiling features tell,

												    "'T will soothing be if I let you see

												    How extremely nice you'll smell."
												  æ
												  'And he stirred it round and round and round,

												    And he sniffed at the foaming froth;

												    When I ups with his heels, and smothers his squeals

												    In the scum of the boiling broth.
												  æ
												  'And I eat that cook in a week or less,

												    And as I eating be

												    The last of his chops, why, I almost drops,

												    For a wessel in sight I see!
											    
												    * * * * * *
											    
												  "And I never larf, and I never smile,

												    And I never lark nor play,

												    But I sit and croak, and a single joke

											      I have--which is to say:
												  æ
												  "Oh, I am a cook and a captain bold,

												    And the mate of the Nancy brig,

												    And a bo'sun tight, and a midshipmite,

											    And the crew of the captain's gig!"



Religious Poems

#######################################################

You come along ... tearing your shirt ... yelling about Jesus.

												    Where do you get that stuff?

												    What do you know about Jesus?

											      Jesus had a way of talking soft and outside of a few bankers and higher-ups among the con-men of Jerusalem everybody liked to have this Jesus around because he never made any fake passes and everything he said went and he helped the sick and gave the people hope.
												  æ
												  You come along squirting words at us, shaking your fist and calling us all damn fools so fierce the froth slobbers over your lips ... always blabbing we're all going to hell straight off and you know all about it.
												  æ
												  I've read Jesus' words. I know what he said. You don't throw any scare into me. I've got your number. I know how much you know about Jesus.

												    He never came near clean people or dirty people but they felt cleaner because he came along. It was your crowd of bankers and business men and lawyers hired the sluggers and murderers who put Jesus out of the running.

												    I say the same bunch backing you nailed the nails into the hands of this Jesus of Nazareth. He had lined up against him the same crooks and strong-arm men now lined up with you paying your way.
												  æ
												  This Jesus was good to look at, smelled good, listened good. He threw out something fresh and beautiful from the skin of his body and the touch of his hands wherever he passed along.

												    You slimy bunkshooter, you put a smut on every human blossom in reach of your rotten breath belching about hell-fire and hiccupping about this Man who lived a clean life in Galilee.
												  æ
												  When are you going to quit making the carpenters build emergency hospitals for women and girls driven crazy with wrecked nerves from your gibberish about Jesus--I put it to you again: Where do you get that stuff; what do you know about Jesus?
												  æ
												  Go ahead and bust all the chairs you want to. Smash a whole wagon load of furniture at every performance. Turn sixy somersaults and stand on your nutty head. If it wasn't for the way you scare the women and kids I'd feel sorry for you and pass the hat.

												    I like to watch a good four-flusher work, but not when he starts people puking and calling for the doctors.

												    I like a man that's go nerve and can pull off a great original performance, but you--you're only a bug-house peddler of second-hand gospel--you're only shoving out a phoney imitation of the goods this Jesus wanted free as air and sunlight.
												  æ
												  You tell people living in shanties Jesus is going to fix it up all right with them by giving them mansions in the skies after they're dead and the worms have eaten 'em.

												    You tell $6 a week department store girls all they need is Jesus; you take a steel trust wop, dead without having lived, gray and shrunken at forty years of age, and you tell him to look at Jesus on the cross and he'll be all right.

												    You tell poor people they don't need any more money on pay day and even if it's fierce to be out of a job, Jesus'll fix that up all right, all right--all they gotta do is take Jesus the way you say.

												    I'm telling you Jesus wouldn't stand for the stuff you're handing out. Jesus played it different. The bankers and lawyers of Jerusalem got their sluggers and murderers to go after Jesus just because Jesus wouldn't play their game. He didn't sit in with the big thieves.
												  æ
												  I don't want a lot of gab from a bunkshooter in my religion.

												    I won't take my religion from any man who never works except with his mouth and never cherishes any memory except the face of the woman on the American silver dollar.
												  æ
												  I ask you to come through and show me where you're pouring out the blood of your life.
												  æ
												  I've been to this suburb of Jerusalem they call Golgotha, where they nailed Him, and I know if the story is straight it was real blood ran from His hands and the nail-holes, and it was real blood spurted in red drops where the spear of the Roman soldier rammed in between the ribs of this Jesus of Nazareth.

The sodden stretches of the months of pregnancy

												    Had had but one green orchid;

												    That was their sole pauseful

												    And suspended moment of beauty.

												    He had brought it home to her at dawn

												    On the day before Christmas,

												    And he was a little drunken as he dropped it on her bed.

												    But it was a green orchid,

												    And pleased she took it unquestioningly.

												    He had bought it with many more

												    Hours and hours earlier for the girl,

												    Who was then amusing him.

												    In some way it had got into his pocket--

												    Or, perhaps, it was his buttonhole.

												    He had noticed it as he entered the abode of maternity,

												    And with his quick sense of values

												    He offered it in a tenderness.

												    He would have sent her orchids every day,

											      But he had no money to spare. He must live.
												  æ
												  He was spending the nine months with her--

												    He had promised to do that--to take care of her

												    Until their child was born--

												    Then she would go away with the child.

												    She was grateful, and, in a way, content.

												    He had taken an apartment for her far from Broadway,

												    And sooner or later every night he came home to her.

												    In the morning she took him his breakfast first,

												    Then gave him a cigarette, and made his telephone calls--

												    There was always one, at least,

												    To arrange for a luncheon or a tea hour,

												    For, continuously, he was deeply in love.

												    He told her all his secrets,

												    And by the eighth month she had come in her daily talks

												    To call three women by their first names.

												    He had loved each one,

												    And he still, it appeared, loved the third.

												    She had lent him all her money,

												    And he was paying it back during the nine months--

												    He made her an allowance each week,

												    And he felt very proud

												    That he gave her so much of his scant income.

												    Every fourth week or so he would be held up

												    On the way home and robbed,

												    But she got the three weeks' money,

												    So she was too wise to question or to remember.
												  æ
												  Soon there were the doctor and the nurse,

												    And the last waiting week had arrived.

												    He was hard to seize then, for he had so many engagements.

												    There was a hint of a new and lovelier girl.

												    But she wrote him notes and left them on his bed,

												    And went about her plans in silence.

												    She made a cheque out to him for all the money

												    She had saved and put in the bank,

												    For she expected to die with her babe,

												    And she wanted him to take the money and bury her

												    And the child in the absurd graveyard in the mountains,

												    Where her adorable drunken father lay.

												    It was having had such a father

												    That let her understand him.

												    She put the cheque

												    In the bottom of her trunk,

												    In which were all her theatrical costumes,

												    And with the cheque she put the biography

												    She had thought out.

												    The biography was for the doctor

												    And his report to the authorities.

												    She was his sister and she was married--

												    Her husband was in the West and was detained

												    From coming to her by imperative business.

												    Thus she smoothed out to niceness

												    The troublesome details of the function of birth.
												  æ
												  In the last night, with the birth pains

												    Gripping her, she came to his bedroom,

												    For he had come home earlier, and her nurse

												    Was asleep after a tiring day.

												    She told him of the cheque and her heart's wishes.

												    He listened tolerantly, and wondered why

												    It was so fascinating to watch a woman in labour.

												    She was silent in her agony,

												    And he rather liked her for that.

												    Then he fell to speculating on the cheque,

												    And he asked himself whether there was

												    Any likelihood that she would die.

												    It seemed a shame, but it would be

												    A solution of the problem.

												    She really wasn't equipped to go on alone

												    With the handicap of a baby,

												    And he would give her the serene burial she longed for.

												    There was four hundred dollars, he learned,

												    But he would spend every sou of it

												    For her funeral and the child's.

												    One could give a flashing party for four hundred dollars,

												    But that was outside the question--

												    He was merely the steward of her estate.
												  æ
												  Next day he had to leave early--

												    The delivery, he was told, was still some hours off,

												    But he would keep in touch by telephone,

												    And he must hear "Manon";

												    It had all been arranged for.

												    It was difficult to telephone,

												    Yet he did after nightfall--during dinner--

												    And he turned a trifle pale when he learned

												    That she had, in truth, died--and the babe with her.

												    In fact, he felt a bit sick.

												    There was much to attend to;

												    He ought to get the cheque at once,

												    And make plans for the burial.

												    He sent for a newspaper to look up an undertaker,

												    And it chanced that the only advertisement he could find

												    Was of one who promised adequate disposal

												    Of the dead for seventy-five dollars.

												    He could not help it--it was thrust at him;

												    And the child would only be a trifle more--

												    At the most one hundred dollars for both,

												    And then there would be three hundred dollars left unneeded.

												    It was sentimental to think about the dead--
												  æ
												  What did it matter where one was buried or how?

												    And he could get the cheque cashed tonight,

												    And this was the night!

												    With three hundred dollars he could give a party

												    That would be memorable,

												    And he had not done much thus far for her.

												    She was of a loveliness,

												    And he was sure he would cease to wander when he got her.

												    Death had simplified everything--

												    It was no use being morose.

												    He could afford a taxi now

												    To get uptown quickly for the cheque.

												    But he would telephone the undertaker first,

												    Then a half dozen people for guests,

												    And, last of all, her who had come at the fitting hour

												    To make his heart glad and at rest.
												  æ
												  It was all swiftly done,

												    And the whir of the motor was grateful music.

												    He had done cruelly by himself to deny his soul

												    For all these months the napory of Rector's

												    And the gold service and the glass.

												    He loved beauty so!

												    He remembered it was absinthe

												    That had made this dear, new woman

												    Kind to him that first night, so in memory

												    He ordered absinthe for himself,

												    While she and his guests drank Pommery.
												  æ
								                He knew he had behaved admirably through the long nine months--

												    He felt it would give a touch of sterling honesty

												    To his character, a stupid, basic honesty

												    He had always so needed.

												    And he let himself sink away from all the immediate past

												    That had been so incongruous and impossible.

												    One way or other the undertaker

												    Would do all that was necessary--

												    He needn't even visit the apartment again.
								                æ
											    And somehow he knew she would invite him

												    To go home with her

												    When they got rid of their guests.

												    He ordered another absinthe!
