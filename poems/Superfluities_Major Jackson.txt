This downpour of bad reasoning, this age-old swarm,

this buzzing about town, this kick and stomp

through gardens, this snag on the way to the mall,

this heap and toss of fabric and strewn shoes, this tangled

beauty, this I came here not knowing, here

to be torched, this fumblingÂ ecstasy, this ecstasy of fumbling,

this spray of lips and fingers, this scrape of bone, this raid

of private grounds, this heaving and rocking, this scream

and push, this sightless hunger, this tattered perishing,

this rhythmic teeth knocking, this unbearable

music, this motionless grip, grimace, and groan.
