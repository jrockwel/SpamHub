Take from the dresser of dealdeal Cheap pine or fir wood, 
Lacking the three glass knobs, that sheet 
On which she embroidered fantailsfantails Birds with a fan-shaped tail once 
And spread it so as to cover her face. 
If her horny feet protrude, they come 
To show how cold she is, and dumb. 
Let the lamp affix its beam. 
The only emperor is the emperor of ice-cream.
