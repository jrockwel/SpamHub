My mother wanted to learn some German

for my father and because her children

could already speak it a little.

She was tired of dusting the stacks of books

she couldn’t read, tired of the letters

she always had to ask him to translate.


He was usually willing to translate

the cards his mother had written in German.

But sometimes there were other letters,

and when he read them to her and the children,

she had the same feeling she’d had with books

before she learned to read, when she was little.


She said it bothered her a little

that her own children would have to translate

for her, that they could pick up the same books

that were as Greek to her as they were German.

She started learning it from her children

and decided to leave my father letters.


She wrote my father daily love letters

and carefully placed them on the little

table where they put things for the children,

next to our favorite set of translations

of fairy tales we first heard in German.

She leaned one every day against his books,


the white paper stark beside the dark books.

But my father never answered her letters.

Instead, he returned them with his German

corrections in the margin, his little

red marks—hieroglyphs for her to translate,

as if she were one of the children.

Maybe she was just one of the children

in that house surrounded by rows of books.

Maybe her whole life was a translation

of what she imagined in the letters.

The space between them made her that little

girl, wandering lost inside the German.


Because her own children were half-German,

she built her life around those little books

translating the lines of her own letters.
