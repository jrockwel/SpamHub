Rise, cleanly trust, divided star,

And spend that delicate fraud upon the night—

A lover’s instance moving mindful air

To make its peace in dedicated light


Whose look is charnel. Lusters, intent and blind,

Give darkness downward with a glow like sheaves—

A gleaner’s pittance withered in the bind

That keeps the summer godhead of the leaves


And bends tremendous evening under it,

Doubles its theft within a lonely course

Till eye and eye repeat the counterfeit

And shape the replenishing mercy at its source.


All else were ravage: a demon-gaze of terror:

The emblem blackened in the living head,

The eye, the image, and the image-bearer

Struck to an awe with smiling on the dead.


Therefore that bounty which, however false,

Tenders survival, and is purely given,

And lends the viewless prisms at its pulse

To make an easy legendry in heaven.

Restore that grace! Indeed, the look is grace

That deals this desert providence in air

And lifts a deathshead, burning, into place

To serve a lover’s faith.
Rise, carrion star.
