if mama

could see

she would see   

lucy sprawling   

limbs of lucy

decorating the

backs of chairs

lucy hair

holding the mirrors up   

that reflect odd   

aspects of lucy.


if mama

could hear

she would hear

lucysong rolled in the

corners like lint

exotic webs of lucysighs

long lucy spiders explaining   

to obscure gods.


if mama

could talk

she would talk

good girl   

good girl   

good girl

clean up your room.
