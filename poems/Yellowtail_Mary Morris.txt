The war was over.

We sutured the wounded,


buried the dead, sat at the bar

with the enemy, near the blue


throat of the sea. A sushi chef

slivered salmon into orchids,


etched clouds from oysters,

as they rose snowing pearls.


From shrimp and seaweed

he shaped hummingbirds,


which hovered above

our heads.


With the worldâ€™s smallest blade

he carved from yellowfin,


miniature flanks of horses.

They cantered around our hands.
