Can you imagine waking up

every morning on a different planet,

each with its own gravity?


Slogging, wobbling,

wavering. Atilt

and out-of-sync

with all that moves

and doesn’t.


Through years of trial

and mostly error

did I study this unsteady way — 


changing pills, adjusting the dosage,

never settling.


A long time we were separate,

O Earth,

but now you have returned to me.
