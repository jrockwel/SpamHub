The difficulty to think at the end of day,   

When the shapeless shadow covers the sun   

And nothing is left except light on your fur—


There was the cat slopping its milk all day,   

Fat cat, red tongue, green mind, white milk   

And August the most peaceful month.


To be, in the grass, in the peacefullest time,   

Without that monument of cat,   

The cat forgotten in the moon;


And to feel that the light is a rabbit-light,   

In which everything is meant for you   

And nothing need be explained;


Then there is nothing to think of. It comes of itself;

And east rushes west and west rushes down,

No matter. The grass is full


And full of yourself. The trees around are for you,   

The whole of the wideness of night is for you,   

A self that touches all edges,


You become a self that fills the four corners of night.

The red cat hides away in the fur-light

And there you are humped high, humped up,


You are humped higher and higher, black as stone—

You sit with your head like a carving in space   

And the little green cat is a bug in the grass.
