The days are dog-eared, the edges torn,   
ragged—like those pages   
I ripped once out of library books, 

for their photos 
of Vallejo and bootless Robert Johnson.   
A fine needs paying now 

it’s true, but   
not by me. 
I am no more guilty 

than that thrush is 
who sits there stripping moss   
off the wet bark of a tree. 

A red fleck, like his, glows 
at the back of my head—a beauty mark,   
left by the brain’s after-jets. 

I would not wish for the three brains   
Robert required 
to double-clutch his guitar 

and chase those sounds he had to know   
led down 
and into a troubled dusky river, always. 

Three brains did Johnson no earthly good,   
neither his nor Vallejo’s 4 & 1/2 
worked right exactly—O bunglers, 

O banged-up pans of disaster! 
Crying for days, said Cesar, & singing for months.   
How can I be so strong some times, 

at others weak? I wish to be free, 
but free to do what? To leave myself behind?   
To switch channels remotely? 

Better to sing. 
Not like the bird, but as they sang,   
Cesar & Robert— 

with the shocked & seeded   
sweetness of an apple 
split open by a meat cleaver.
