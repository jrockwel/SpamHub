Crowned with a feathered helmet,

Not for disguise or courtship

Dance, he looks like something

Birthed by swallowing its tail,


Woven from a selfish design

& guesswork. As if masked

With a see-through caul

From breast to hipbone,


His cold breath silvers

Panes of his hilltop house

Into a double reflection.

Silhouetted almost into a woman,


He can beg forgiveness now

As he leans against a window

Overlooking Narcissusâ€™s pond

Choked with a memory of lilies.
