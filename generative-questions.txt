questions:
—what is an epoch?
	—num iterations = num training samples = 1 epoch
	—900s/epoch
—what is the loss metric being calculated
	—where is it coming from 
	—how is it being calculated
—what is batch size
//
-seq len=length of sequence to learn
    -parameter to play w/, does changing seq len impact quality of model?
-why use softmax as output eq?
-what is output in the output file?
//
-lstm [Long Short Term Memory]
    -num_units [number of units for layer]
    -type of RNN that factors in order dependance of sequences
        [machinelearningmastery]

//
increased batch size + smaller training set -> higher loss values
	—but runs faster

larger training set w/ large batch size -> lower loss values
